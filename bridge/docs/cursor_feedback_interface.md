# Cursor Feedback Interface Specification

This document outlines the JSON structure for feedback messages sent from the Cursor Bridge back to the originating GPT agent.

## Schema

Feedback messages MUST adhere to the `bridge/schemas/cursor_feedback_schema.json` schema.

Key fields:
- `request_id` (string, uuid): Matches the ID of the original GPT command request.
- `timestamp` (string, date-time): ISO 8601 timestamp of feedback generation.
- `command_type` (string, enum): The type of the original command.
- `status` (string, enum): Indicates the outcome.
  - `success`: The command executed successfully via the actual Cursor tool.
  - `error`: An error occurred during validation, execution, or processing.
  - `simulated_success`: The command was processed successfully by the bridge simulation (actual tool not called).
- `result` (object | string | array | null): Contains the output data or error details.
  - For `success`/`simulated_success`: Typically an object or array matching the expected output of the Cursor tool.
  - For `error`: Typically a string containing an error message or an object with error details.

## Feedback Mechanism

Feedback payloads are generated by the bridge after processing each incoming GPT command. They are placed as individual JSON files into the `bridge/outgoing_feedback/` directory. The GPT agent (or an intermediary component) is responsible for monitoring this location and consuming the feedback files.

# Task List: utils Module (`/d:/Dream.os/utils/`)

Tasks related to shared utility functions and helper classes.

## I. Utility Review & Organization

-   [ ] **Catalog Utilities:** List the utility functions and classes within `/d:/Dream.os/utils/`.
-   [ ] **Assess Usage:** Determine where each utility is used across the project.
-   [ ] **Identify Redundancy:** Check for duplicate or overlapping functionality with other utils or core components (e.g., in `/d:/Dream.os/_core/`).
-   [ ] **Organize Structure:** Ensure a logical organization (sub-modules or clear naming) if the number of utilities is large.

## II. Refactoring & Improvement

-   [ ] **Code Quality:** Review utilities for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards.
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Ensure utilities have robust error handling for expected failure modes.
-   [ ] **Consolidation:** Move utilities to more specific modules (e.g., `/d:/Dream.os/_core/`, `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/core/utils/`) if they are not broadly applicable.

## III. Task/Coordination Related Utilities

-   [ ] **Task List Utils:** Review any utilities specifically designed for reading, writing, or manipulating `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`. Ensure they are consistent with the logic in `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/dispatchers/task_dispatcher.py` and use file locking (`portalocker`) correctly.
-   [ ] **AgentBus Utils:** Review any helper functions related to `AgentBus` event creation or parsing.

## IV. Testing

-   [ ] **Add Unit Tests:** Ensure all utility functions and classes have comprehensive unit tests covering various inputs and edge cases.

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Utilities:** Add clear docstrings to all functions and classes explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised.
-   [ ] **Module README (Optional):** Consider a README in `/d:/Dream.os/utils/` if the organization is complex.

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes to utility code and tests.
-   [ ] Ensure utilities are well-tested, documented, and organized.

# Task List: tools Module (`/d:/Dream.os/tools/`)

Tasks related to developer tools, utilities, and helper applications.

## I. TaskListVisualizer (`/d:/Dream.os/tools/task_list_visualizer.py`)

-   [x] Initial Implementation (Tkinter GUI).
-   [ ] **Refinement & Robustness:**
    -   [ ] Improve error handling (e.g., file not found for `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`, invalid JSON).
    -   [ ] Make refresh interval configurable (e.g., via command-line argument or config file).
    -   [ ] Consider performance for very large task lists.
-   [ ] **Feature Enhancements (Optional - Bonus Upgrades):**
    -   [ ] Task search by ID.
    -   [ ] Manual status override button (requires careful implementation - maybe dispatch a task?).
    -   [ ] Retry button for failed tasks (dispatch a new task?).
    -   [ ] Manual task injection form.
    -   [ ] Separate event log window (requires AgentBus integration or log file monitoring).

## II. Other Tools

-   [ ] **Task Injection Tool:** Implement the task injection script discussed in `/d:/Dream.os/scripts/task_list.md` (could potentially live here or in `scripts`).
-   [ ] **Agent Simulation/Debugging Tools:** Consider tools to simulate `AgentBus` events or inspect agent states for easier debugging.
-   [ ] **Log Viewer/Analyzer:** A tool specifically for viewing/filtering system or agent logs.

## III. Code Quality & Maintenance

-   [ ] **Review Existing Tools:** Check code quality, dependencies, and usability of any other tools in `/d:/Dream.os/tools/`.
-   [ ] **Refactor Common Code:** Identify and refactor any shared logic between tools.
-   [ ] **Testing:** Add tests for core tool logic (e.g., `load_tasks` in visualizer, task injection logic).

## IV. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document `TaskListVisualizer`:** Add usage instructions to `/d:/Dream.os/docs/task_list.md`.
-   [ ] **Document Other Tools:** Provide clear usage instructions for any other developer tools.

## V. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes to tool code.
-   [ ] Ensure tools are functional and documented.

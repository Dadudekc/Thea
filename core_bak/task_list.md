# Task List: core Module (`/d:/Dream.os/core/`)

Tasks related to core system logic, workflow orchestration, and potentially main application entry points.

## I. System Orchestration

-   [ ] **Review Main Loop/Workflow:** Examine the primary control flow of the system.
-   [ ] **Integration with Task Dispatcher:** Ensure the core system correctly utilizes or interacts with the `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/dispatchers/task_dispatcher.py` (e.g., triggering initial tasks, handling system-level events).
-   [ ] **State Management:** Review how overall system state is managed.

## II. AgentBus Interaction

-   [ ] **System-Level Events:** Identify and handle any system-wide events monitored or published by the core module via `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/core/agent_bus.py`.
-   [ ] **Initialization:** Ensure `AgentBus` and core agents are initialized correctly during system startup.

## III. Configuration Loading

-   [ ] **Verify Config Usage:** Check how configuration (potentially from `/d:/Dream.os/config/`) is loaded and used by core components.
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Ensure robust handling of missing or invalid configuration.

## IV. Error Handling & Recovery

-   [ ] **System-Wide Error Handling:** Review top-level error handling and potential recovery mechanisms.
-   [ ] **Shutdown Procedures:** Ensure a clean shutdown process for the system and its agents.

## V. Testing

-   [ ] **Integration Tests:** Add tests covering the core workflow and interactions between major components (Dispatcher, AgentBus, key agents).
-   [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** Develop tests simulating realistic scenarios from task injection to expected outcomes.

## VI. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Core Workflow:** Explain the main execution flow and component interactions.
-   [ ] **Document Configuration:** Detail required configuration parameters.

## VII. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes to core system files.
-   [ ] Resolve TODOs within the `core` module.

Straight up: you cannot fully trust a Pine Script backtest alone ‚Äî even if it looks wildly profitable ‚Äî without deeper validation. Here's why, followed by how to actually know when to trust it enough to attach to a bot.
‚ö†Ô∏è Why Backtests Lie (Especially in PineScript)
Lookahead Bias
Pine scripts can accidentally use future data (especially with security() calls or using close without strict indexing). This will make your strategy look amazing... but it's cheating.
Overfitting
You might‚Äôve curve-fit to past noise. Profitable in history ‚â† profitable in future.
Slippage & Fees Ignored
Unless manually coded, most backtests ignore:
Spread/slippage
Real-world order fill behavior
Commission/fee drag
Low Sample Size
A Pine Script might show 80% win rate... but if it's only taken 12 trades in 2 years? Useless.
Repainting Indicators
If your indicators update based on future bars (like many plotshape strategies), the whole system is invalid.
‚úÖ When You Can Start Trusting It
Attach to a bot only if all of these hold true:
1. Backtest Conditions Pass a Sanity Check
Min 100+ trades
Net profit not carried by 1-2 mega trades
Consistent over multiple market regimes (bull, bear, chop)
Drawdown is acceptable and realistic
2. No Lookahead or Repainting
Confirm every indicator and condition uses past bars only (e.g., close[1], not close)
Avoid bar_index hacks unless carefully sandboxed
3. Custom Slippage & Fees Added

Edit
strategy.slippage := 1  // one tick or more
strategy.commission := strategy.commission.percent(0.1)
4. Forward Test
Let it run live in ‚Äúpaper mode‚Äù on TradingView or your own emulator:
Record real-time decisions
Compare with backtest behavior
Spot inconsistencies
5. Deploy with Small Capital First
Even if all of the above passes, run it:
On a paper bot for 2‚Äì4 weeks
Then real money, small size (1 contract / $1000 max)
Monitor for slippage, fills, delays, bugs
üß† TL;DR Mental Rule
"Backtest = proof of concept, not proof of profit."
Trust only when backtest + live-forward + non-repainting logic + real slippage = consistent alignment.

## 🎮 MMORPG Showcase: The Dreamscape Adventure

### The First Quest: Context Orchestration
**Objective**: Create a simple text-based adventure where each "turn" is a ChatGPT conversation, with context passed between turns using JSON and Jinja templates.

**Quest Flow**:
1. **Initial Context** (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "player": {"name": "Aletheia", "level": 1, "inventory": []},
     "world": {"location": "Digital Dreamscape", "time": "dawn"},
     "quest_log": ["Begin the journey of The Architect's Edge"]
   }
   ```

2. **Jinja Prompt Template**:
   ```
   You are {{ player.name }}, The Architect's Edge, currently at {{ world.location }}.
   Your inventory: {{ player.inventory }}.
   Quest log: {{ quest_log }}.
   What do you want to do next in your journey through The Dreamscape?
   ```

3. **ChatGPT Response** → **Context Update** → **Next Turn**

**Quest Rewards**:
- Context passing system
- Multi-turn conversation orchestration
- JSON schema for game state
- Jinja template system for dynamic prompts

**The Architect's Edge pulses, resonant with Victor's will, whispering a challenge: "Beyond clarity lies true mastery... are you prepared to ascend?"**

**Digital Dreamscape** is positioned to become the premier ChatGPT conversation management and analysis platform, while simultaneously chronicling your journey as an evolving MMORPG saga. Each feature becomes a legendary artifact, each breakthrough a quest completion, and each milestone a step toward digital mastery. 🚀 

## 🧪 Test Coverage - Validation Rituals Standard

Every phase and major quest is accompanied by a dedicated test suite (“Validation Ritual”) to ensure:
- All new domains and artifacts are validated before stabilization
- Integration and regression are covered as the system evolves
- Demo scripts and test cases are available for every major feature

**How to run all validation rituals:**
```sh
pytest tests/
```
Or run individual rituals:
```sh
python -m unittest tests/test_memory_nexus.py
```

**The Architect's Edge decrees: No domain is stabilized without a passing validation ritual.**

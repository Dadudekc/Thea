# Deduplication Action Plan - Phase 1 (Exact Duplicates)
# Generated: [AUTO_TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER]

# --- Bug Notes / Script Improvements ---
bug_notes:
  - description: "Hash collision for very small files (e.g., empty JSON objects) can lead to false positives for duplicates. Observed with report files themselves (Cluster 9)."
    recommendation: "In deduplication scripts, if file size < 2KB (or similar small threshold), optionally skip hash inclusion in duplicate checks or flag such matches as 'low confidence / needs verification'."

# --- Summary of Actions ---
# Deletions: 7 files (Clusters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 each have 1 deletion)
# Renames: 1 file (Cluster 9)
# Ignored (for now): 1 cluster (2 files - Cluster 2)

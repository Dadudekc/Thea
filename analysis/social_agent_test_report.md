# Social Agent Test Suite Summary Report

**Task ID:** `social-new-010`
**Date Generated:** $(date --iso-8601=seconds) <!-- Placeholder -->

## Overview

This report summarizes the test suite developed for the `SocialMediaAgent` and related components as part of task `social-new-010`. The goal was to create unit and integration tests covering main functionalities, including mailbox processing, driver initialization, strategy interactions, and basic API/error handling.

## Test Files Created / Modified

- **`tests/test_social_media_agent.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `SocialMediaAgent` class.
  - Mocks dependencies like `MailboxHandler`, configuration loading, `log_event`, `get_undetected_driver`, and `importlib.import_module`.
- **`tests/test_social_agent_e2e.py`**: Contains basic end-to-end integration tests simulating the agent's operational loop with mocked strategies and mailbox.
- **`tests/test_linkedin_strategy.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `LinkedInStrategy`, mocking `requests` for API calls.
- **`tests/test_reddit_strategy.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `RedditStrategy`, mocking the `praw` library.
- **`tests/test_twitter_strategy.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `TwitterStrategy`, mocking Selenium WebDriver interactions and exceptions, focusing on error logging.

## Coverage Summary

The test suite covers the following areas:

### `SocialMediaAgent` (`tests/test_social_media_agent.py`)

- **Initialization:**
  - Configuration loading (`_load_config`).
  - `MailboxHandler` initialization.
- **Mailbox Processing (`process_incoming_message`):**
  - Handling of valid commands: `login`, `post`, `check_login_status`, `scrape_mentions`, `scrape_trends`, `scrape_community`, `agent_status`.
  - Handling of unknown commands.
  - Handling of malformed messages (missing `command`).
  - Verification of response generation (`_send_response` via mock).
- **Driver Initialization (`_initialize_driver`):**
  - Successful driver creation using `get_undetected_driver`.
  - Handling exceptions during driver creation and logging errors.
- **Strategy Loading (`_get_or_load_strategy`):**
  - Successful dynamic loading and instantiation of a strategy on first call.
  - Correctly returning cached instance on subsequent calls.
  - Handling `ModuleNotFoundError` when strategy module doesn't exist.
  - Verification of driver initialization attempt during strategy load.
- **Facade Methods (Calling Strategies):**
  - `post`: Verifies strategy loading, calling strategy's `post`, handling success/failure/errors, logging `PLATFORM_POST`.
  - `scrape_mentions`: Verifies strategy loading, calling strategy's `scrape_mentions`, handling success/failure/missing method, logging `PLATFORM_SCRAPE` or warnings.
  - `scrape_trends`: Verifies successful call to strategy and logging.
  - `scrape_community`: Verifies successful call to strategy and logging.

### End-to-End Simulation (`tests/test_social_agent_e2e.py`)

- Simulates the agent finding messages via mocked `MailboxHandler`.
- Simulates processing sequences (e.g., login then post).
- Simulates strategy success and failure scenarios.
- Verifies responses are captured via mocked `MailboxHandler`.
- Verifies expected strategy method calls.

### Strategy-Specific Tests

- **LinkedIn (`tests/test_linkedin_strategy.py`):**
  - Mocked API calls (`requests`).
  - Tested successful OAuth token exchange (`login`).
  - Tested failed OAuth token exchange.
  - Tested successful text post.
  - Tested posting failure when not logged in.
  - Tested handling of API errors during post.
- **Reddit (`tests/test_reddit_strategy.py`):**
  - Mocked PRAW library interactions.
  - Tested successful login/initialization.
  - Tested successful text post.
  - Tested successful mention scraping.
  - Tested handling of PRAW API exceptions during post.
  - Tested mention scraping when no mentions are found.
- **Twitter (`tests/test_twitter_strategy.py`):**
  - Mocked Selenium WebDriver and exceptions.
  - Tested error handling for `TimeoutException` during login, verifying error logging and screenshot attempt.
  - Tested error handling for `NoSuchElementException` during post, verifying error logging and screenshot attempt.

## Exclusions / Future Work

- **Comprehensive Strategy Error Cases:** While basic error handling is tested, more specific API error codes or edge cases within each strategy could be added.
- **External Dependencies:** Tests rely heavily on mocking. Full integration tests requiring live APIs or WebDriver interactions are not included (partially covered by manual tasks like `social-new-002`).
- **`MailboxHandler` Unit Tests:** The `MailboxHandler` utility itself is mocked, not unit tested here. Separate tests for its file system interactions could be created.
- **Test Coverage Metrics:** Formal test coverage reports were not generated as part of this task deliverable but could be added using tools like `coverage.py`.
- **Deliverable Validation:** The tests verify internal logic and calls. Validating the actual *content* of generated reports (like this one, or others specified in tasks) is not part of the automated suite.

## Conclusion

The implemented test suite provides foundational coverage for the `SocialMediaAgent` and its interactions with key components like the mailbox and strategies. It focuses on unit testing core logic and simulating integration points through mocking. This suite helps ensure the agent handles commands correctly, loads strategies dynamically, and manages basic error conditions.

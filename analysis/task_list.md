# Task List: analysis Module (`/d:/Dream.os/analysis/`)

Tasks related to data analysis, performance monitoring, and system evaluation.

## I. Analysis Scripts & Tools

-   [ ] **Identify Analysis Goals:** Define the key metrics and questions to be answered (e.g., task completion rates, agent response times, error frequencies, resource usage).
-   [ ] **Review/Implement Scripts:** Develop or refine scripts within `/d:/Dream.os/analysis/` to perform these analyses.
-   [ ] **Data Sources:** Ensure scripts correctly access necessary data (e.g., `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`, logs from `/d:/Dream.os/logs/`, performance metrics).

## II. Data Visualization

-   [ ] **Visualization Needs:** Determine required visualizations (e.g., task status trends, agent load distribution).
-   [ ] **Implement Visualizations:** Use appropriate libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) within analysis scripts or dedicated tools to generate visualizations.
-   [ ] **Integration with Reports:** Consider integrating key visualizations into reports generated from `/d:/Dream.os/reports/`.

## III. Performance Monitoring

-   [ ] **Define Metrics:** Specify key performance indicators (KPIs) for the system and individual agents.
-   [ ] **Implement Monitoring:** Develop mechanisms to collect and track these KPIs (potentially involving `AgentBus` events or log parsing).
-   [ ] **Alerting (Optional):** Consider adding alerts for performance degradation or critical metric thresholds.

## IV. Testing & Validation

-   [ ] **Test Analysis Logic:** Verify the correctness of calculations and logic within analysis scripts.
-   [ ] **Validate Data Sources:** Ensure the data being analyzed is accurate and complete.

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Analysis Scripts:** Explain the purpose, usage, and output of each script.
-   [ ] **Document Metrics:** Define how KPIs and other analyzed metrics are calculated.
-   [ ] **Summarize Findings:** Document key findings or insights derived from the analysis.

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit analysis scripts and related code.
-   [ ] Ensure analysis tools provide valuable insights into system behavior.

# Task List: reports Module (`/d:/Dream.os/reports/`)

Tasks related to generating, storing, and managing system reports.

## I. Report Generation

-   [ ] **Identify Report Types:** List the different reports generated by the system (e.g., task summaries, agent performance, error logs, test results).
-   [ ] **Review Generation Logic:** Examine the code responsible for generating each report type.
-   [ ] **Data Sources:** Verify reports use correct data sources (e.g., `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`, logs, AgentBus metrics if available).
-   [ ] **Format & Clarity:** Ensure reports are well-formatted, clear, and provide actionable information.

## II. Automation

-   [ ] **Automated Generation:** Determine if report generation should be automated (e.g., triggered by specific events on `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/core/agent_bus.py`, scheduled tasks).
-   [ ] **Implement Automation:** Develop scripts or agent logic to automate report generation as needed.

## III. Storage & Access

-   [ ] **Storage Location:** Confirm `/d:/Dream.os/reports/` is the appropriate location.
-   [ ] **Naming Conventions:** Define clear naming conventions for report files (e.g., including timestamps, report type).
-   [ ] **Archiving/Rotation:** Implement a strategy for managing old reports (similar to `task_list.json` archiving).

## IV. Testing

-   [ ] **Test Report Accuracy:** Add tests to verify the content and calculations within generated reports.
-   [ ] **Test Generation Logic:** Test the report generation code under various conditions (e.g., empty data, large data sets).

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Report Types:** Explain each available report, its purpose, and how to interpret it (e.g., in `/d:/Dream.os/docs/task_list.md`).
-   [ ] **Document Generation Process:** Detail how reports are generated (manually or automatically).

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes related to report generation or management.
-   [ ] Ensure reports are accurate and useful.

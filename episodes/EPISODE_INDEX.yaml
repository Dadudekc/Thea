  codename: ''
  title: Implement a continuous operational loop for all eight cursor agents, ensuring
    mission adherence (drift-proofing) through automated monitoring and AI-driven
    escalation. This system will utilize agent-specific inboxes for dynamic tasking
    and state management, complemented by persistent lifecycle logs, to foster adaptive
    responsiveness and robust self-correction.
  theme: Full-circle agent task automation without human intervention.
  north_star: Agents self-resume, complete tasks, refresh task board, and reinitiate—all
    on their own.
  status: Completed
  artifacts:
  - 'YAML-PARSER-008: Parse episode YAML and extract task list per agent.'
  - 'PROMPT-DISPERSER-009: Write parsed tasks into correct inbox files using structured
    prompt format.'
  - 'LOOP-WATCHDOG-001: `inbox_watcher.py`: monitor timestamps every 60s, trigger
    auto-resume on stale state.'
  - 'ESCALATION-003: On 5th resume, send context to ChatGPT and await tailored reply.'
  - 'TASK-CHECK-004: `loop_orchestrator.py`: detect empty task queue and call `refresh_task_queue()`.'
  - 'REFRESH-FLOW-005: Inject new tasks into each agent''s inbox, rotate prompts.'
  - 'FULL-LOOP-006: Run full cycle: Task > Resume > Escalate > Complete > Refresh
    > Inject > Resume.'
  - 'LOG-LOOP-007: Write lifecycle entries to `agent_<n>.md` and update `devlog.md`.'
  - 'YAML-PARSER-008: (Agent-7) Create `episode_parser.py` to read episode YAML and
    extract agent-specific task segments.'
  - 'PROMPT-DISPERSER-009: (Agent-8) Build `disperse_tasks.py` that writes each parsed
    task to `agent_<n>/inbox.json`.'

  updated_at: '2025-05-11T03:47:45.820470'
  objectives:
  - Maintain inbox timestamp tracking, self-resume, and escalation logic.
  - Enable task completion detection and refresh queue from ChatGPT.
  - Build YAML → Agent Prompt dispersal engine (by Agent-7 + 8).
  definition_of_done:
  - All 8 agents active and contributing to loop operations or system enhancements.
  - Episode YAML can be parsed and distributed to agent inboxes automatically.
  - Logs and devlogs show end-to-end execution and refresh cycles.

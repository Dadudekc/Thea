episode: "02"
codename: "INFINITE LOOPS"
overall_refined_objective: "Implement a continuous operational loop for all eight cursor agents, ensuring mission adherence (drift-proofing) through automated monitoring and AI-driven escalation. This system will utilize agent-specific inboxes for dynamic tasking and state management, complemented by persistent lifecycle logs, to foster adaptive responsiveness and robust self-correction."
theme: "Full-circle agent task automation without human intervention."
north_star: "Agents self-resume, complete tasks, refresh task board, and reinitiate—all on their own."

objectives:
  - "Maintain inbox timestamp tracking, self-resume, and escalation logic."
  - "Enable task completion detection and refresh queue from ChatGPT."
  - "Build YAML → Agent Prompt dispersal engine (by Agent-7 + 8)."

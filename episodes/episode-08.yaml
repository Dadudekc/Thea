  events in real-time. Each agent is responsible for maintaining its designated role
  within the swarm while adapting to changing conditions. Adherence to the newly standardized
  task schema is mandatory.

preamble: 'Building on the foundations established in Episode 07, Dream.OS now advances
  to Phase 2 of the Full Auto Arc. This episode focuses on three critical areas: Live
  Swarm Autonomy with event-driven coordination, Cursor Agent Bridge for seamless
  interaction, and BasicBot deployment to demonstrate real-world application capabilities.
  The newly standardized project architecture and task schema will power a more resilient
  and responsive system.'
risks_and_mitigation:
- mitigation: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring. Start with simple event
    types and gradually increase complexity as stability is confirmed.
  risk: Event-driven system complexity leads to race conditions or deadlocks.
- mitigation: Conduct thorough security review of all bridge components. Implement
    proper authentication, encryption, and input validation.
  risk: Cursor Agent Bridge security vulnerabilities expose the system to external
    threats.
- mitigation: Create detailed environment specification documents. Test deployment
    in controlled environments before production release.
  risk: BasicBot deployment encounters unforeseen environment-specific issues.

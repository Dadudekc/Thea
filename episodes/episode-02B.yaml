episode: "02B"
codename: "ARCHITECTURE REFINEMENT"
overall_refined_objective: "Streamline and optimize the codebase architecture through systematic cleanup, deduplication, and structural refinement. This initiative focuses on eliminating redundancy, improving code organization, and establishing clear patterns for future development."
theme: "Clean, maintainable, and efficient codebase structure."
north_star: "A lean, well-organized codebase with minimal duplication and clear architectural boundaries."

objectives:
  - "Identify and remove redundant scripts and utilities"
  - "Realign directory structure for better organization"
  - "Document high-impact architectural decisions"
  - "Establish clear patterns for future development"

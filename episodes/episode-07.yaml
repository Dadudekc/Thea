title: "Alignment & Emergence (Full Auto Arc - Phase 1)"
preamble: "The swarm awakens to initiate Phase 1 of the Full Auto Arc. This episode marks a concerted effort to address all 13 foundational requirements for true autonomous operation, distributing these critical system-hardening tasks across the entire swarm. Success in this episode will lay the essential groundwork for a self-regulating, resilient Dream.OS. Refer to specs/FULL_AUTO_ARC.md for the overarching strategic goals."
theme: "Comprehensive Foundational Hardening for Full Autonomy: Addressing All 13 Strategic ARC Requirements."

core_objectives:
  - "Initiate and make significant progress on all 13 Core Requirements outlined in specs/FULL_AUTO_ARC.md."
  - "Distribute responsibility for these 13 ARC requirements across the 8 available agents, ensuring each agent has a clear, actionable, and high-impact set of tasks."
  - "Establish initial implementations or robust solution designs for the most critical ARC items, particularly those related to agent reliability, task management, and core utilities."
  - "Ensure all agents actively review specs/FULL_AUTO_ARC.md and understand how their assigned tasks contribute to the larger strategic goals."
  - "Launch DevlogAgent (ARC #related, from previous plan) to ensure visibility of this comprehensive effort."
  - "Implement Captain Agent & Discord Commander roles to aid coordination of this wide-ranging episode."

loop_enforcement_protocol: "Agents must diligently process their entire inbox queue every operational cycle, then claim and execute their assigned tasks contributing to the Full Auto Arc. Adherence to Universal and Captain Agent Loop protocols is mandatory. Loop until significant progress is made on assigned ARC requirements."

definition_of_done:
  - "A tangible deliverable (e.g., implemented module, completed utility, robust design document, functional test suite for a component) is produced for each of the 13 ARC requirements, or for significant sub-parts if a requirement is very large."
  - "All 8 agents have successfully completed their primary assigned tasks related to the Full Auto Arc requirements, with clear validation criteria met."
  - "The DevlogAgent is operational and actively logging progress and key events related to ARC task execution."
  - "Captain Agent and Discord Commander roles are active and demonstrably aiding in the coordination and visibility of this episode's efforts."
  - "A clear status report on each of the 13 ARC requirements is available at the end of the episode, detailing progress made, challenges encountered, and next steps for subsequent episodes."

risks_and_mitigation:
  - risk: "Scope of addressing all 13 ARC items in one episode is too large, leading to agent overload or superficial implementations."
    mitigation: "Agents should focus on achieving tangible progress and robust 'Phase 1' deliverables for their assigned ARC items, rather than complete resolution of every sub-point. Prioritize foundational aspects. Captain Agent (Agent-6) to monitor for overload."
  - risk: "Dependencies between ARC items cause bottlenecks (e.g., DevlogAgent needed for monitoring)."
    mitigation: "Agents to communicate dependencies early. If Agent-8 is blocked by DevlogAgent, they can use fallback monitoring methods initially. Critical path items (like task execution) to get priority."

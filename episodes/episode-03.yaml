narrative: "After the silent collapse of Episode 2's night loop, the swarm awakened to fragmented logs and dormant processes. Agent-1 deployed to trace the last heartbeat. Agent-2 revised ancient feedback sigils. As dusk returned, Agent-4 braved another full-cycle test run. This episode marks the beginning of the Reforging."

- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 3. Task: Develop Script Execution Wrapper
- **Proposed ID:** `DEV-SCRIPT-EXEC-WRAPPER-001`
- **Name:** Develop Standardized Script Execution Wrapper
- **Justification:** Addresses root cause of script execution failures (`ModuleNotFoundError`) identified in `INVESTIGATE-SCRIPT-EXEC-ENV-001` by providing a reliable, environment-aware execution utility for the swarm.

### 4. Task: Align Tool Execution Interface
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-TOOL-EXEC-INTERFACE-001`
- **Name:** Align ToolExecutionAgent with BaseTool Interface
- **Justification:** Resolves inconsistency between ToolExecutionAgent call signature and BaseTool abstract method, ensuring tools can be executed reliably.

### 5. Task: Clarify Agent2 Task Triggering
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-AGENT2-TRIGGER-001`
- **Name:** Clarify and Refactor Agent2 Task Triggering Logic

- **Priority:** LOW

### 6. Task: Improve Agent9 Injector
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-AGENT9-INJECTOR-001`
- **Name:** Improve Agent9ResponseInjector Flexibility and Task Tracking
- **Justification:** Addresses hardcoded target agent and lack of task board visibility for tasks generated by Agent9. Proposes configuration and optional board integration.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 7. Task: Review ChatGPT Web Agent
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-CHATGPT-WEB-AGENT-001`
- **Name:** Review and Refactor ChatGPTWebAgent
- **Justification:** Addresses architectural divergence (no AgentBus), incomplete logic, fragile scraping dependencies, and non-standard implementation.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 8. Task: Enhance Context Router
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-CONTEXT-ROUTER-001`
- **Name:** Enhance ContextRouterAgent Routing Logic
- **Justification:** Improves basic keyword routing with suggestions for regex, structured data matching, and rule priorities.
- **Priority:** LOW

### 9. Task: Review Cursor Dispatcher
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-CURSOR-DISPATCHER-001`
- **Name:** Review and Refactor CursorDispatcher
- **Justification:** Addresses architectural silo (local file queue, virtual desktop), queue robustness issues, complex dependencies, and limited status tracking.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 10. Task: Review Cursor Worker
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-CURSOR-WORKER-001`
- **Name:** Review and Refactor CursorWorker Implementation
- **Justification:** Addresses non-standard blob channel communication, fragile UI automation reliance, and lack of BaseAgent integration.
- **Priority:** HIGH

### 11. Task: Review Feedback Router
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-FEEDBACK-ROUTER-001`
- **Name:** Review and Refactor TaskFeedbackRouter
- **Justification:** Addresses file-system-based architecture, ephemeral state (risk of reprocessing), and lack of AgentBus integration.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 12. Task: Improve Onboarding Utils
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-ONBOARDING-UTILS-001`
- **Name:** Improve Onboarding Contract Update Utility
- **Justification:** Improves robustness of contract updates by implementing atomic writes and better error reporting, externalizing config.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 13. Task: Refactor PBM CLI
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-PBM-CLI-001`
- **Name:** Refactor ProjectBoardManager CLI
- **Justification:** Separates core ProjectBoardManager logic from its command-line interface for better reusability and maintainability.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 14. Task: Refactor Recovery Agent
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-RECOVERY-AGENT-001`
- **Name:** Refactor and Verify RecoveryCoordinatorAgent
- **Justification:** Addresses hardcoded configuration, unclear utility dependencies, and potential query inefficiencies.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 15. Task: Review Supervisor Agent Architecture
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-SUPERVISOR-AGENT-ARCH-001`
- **Name:** Review and Align SupervisorAgent Architecture
- **Justification:** Addresses architectural silo (file/channel polling vs. AgentBus), ephemeral state, and polling inefficiencies.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 16. Task: Refactor Task Executor Agent
- **Proposed ID:** `REFACTOR-TASK-EXEC-AGENT-001`
- **Name:** Refactor TaskExecutorAgent
- **Justification:** Addresses local TaskStatus definition, hardcoded recipient, lack of BaseAgent inheritance, and potentially inefficient single dispatch.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 18. Task: Verify Event Payload Imports
- **Proposed ID:** `VERIFY-EVENT-PAYLOAD-IMPORTS-001`
- **Name:** Verify Enum Imports in event_payloads.py
- **Justification:** Corrects potentially broken enum imports in event_payloads.py based on comments indicating uncertainty.
- **Priority:** LOW

### 19. Task: Cleanup AgentBus EventTypes
- **Proposed ID:** `CLEANUP-AGENTBUS-EVENTTYPES-001`
- **Name:** Clean Up EventType Enum in AgentBus
- **Justification:** Removes commented-out old event types from EventType enum definition for clarity and maintainability.

# Task List: scripts Module (`/d:/Dream.os/scripts/`)

Tasks related to utility scripts, automation, and one-off processes.

## I. Script Review & Updates

-   [ ] **Identify Key Scripts:** List the essential scripts used for building, testing, deployment, or system maintenance.
-   [ ] **Review Functionality:** Verify each script performs its intended function correctly.
-   [ ] **Update for System Changes:** Ensure scripts are compatible with recent changes (e.g., `AgentBus`, task list format in `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`, directory structures).
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Improve error handling and reporting within scripts.

## II. Task Management Integration

-   [ ] **Task Injection Script:**
    -   [ ] Consider creating a script to easily inject tasks into `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json` for testing or manual triggering.
    -   [ ] Ensure the script creates tasks with the correct schema.
-   [ ] **Task List Maintenance Scripts:**
    -   [ ] Implement the task archiving/rotation script designed in `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.md`.
    -   [ ] Consider scripts for validating `task_list.json` integrity.

## III. Automation & CI/CD

-   [ ] **Review CI/CD Scripts:** Ensure build, test, and deployment scripts (if applicable) are up-to-date and reliable.
-   [ ] **Dependency Management:** Verify scripts correctly handle project dependencies (`/d:/Dream.os/requirements.txt` or similar).

## IV. Documentation

-   [ ] **Script Usage:** Add comments or documentation explaining the purpose and usage of each key script.
-   [ ] **README:** Consider adding a `/d:/Dream.os/scripts/README.md` summarizing the available scripts.

## V. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit any changes to script files.
-   [ ] Ensure all necessary utility scripts are functional and documented.

# Agent Coordination Hub (`specs/`)

This directory serves as the central coordination point for all agent activities within the Dream.os project.

It contains:

*   `README.md`: This file - overview of the directory.
*   `project_structure.txt`: An ASCII representation of the project's file and directory structure. Agents should consult this for navigation and update it as the structure evolves.
*   `mission_updates.md`: A log of active missions, agent assignments, progress updates, and any encountered blockers. This is the primary source of truth for what agents are currently working on.

Agents should review `mission_updates.md` upon activation and update it regularly with their status.

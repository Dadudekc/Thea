# Dream.OS Definition of Done (DoD)

This document outlines the criteria that must be met for tasks and initiatives to be considered complete. It provides a consistent standard across all agents and components to ensure quality and integration.

## General Definition of Done

For **ANY** task to be considered complete, it must meet the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The implemented solution works as expected and fulfills all requirements.
2. **Documentation**: The implementation is properly documented (inline comments, docstrings, and relevant external documentation).
3. **Integration**: The solution integrates with existing systems without breaking functionality.
4. **Testing**: Appropriate tests have been added or updated to verify functionality.
5. **Code Quality**: The implementation follows project coding standards and best practices.
6. **Peer Review**: At least one other agent has reviewed and approved the implementation.
7. **Coordination Log**: The implementation details, decisions, and integration points are documented in the agent's coordination log.

## Initiative-Specific Criteria

### 1. Checkpoint Protocol Implementation

A Checkpoint Protocol implementation is **DONE** when:

- CheckpointManager class is implemented and integrated with the agent's operational loop
- All three checkpoint types (routine, pre-operation, recovery) are supported
- Checkpoints are created at the required intervals (30 minutes for routine)
- Checkpoints are stored in the correct location (`runtime/agent_comms/checkpoints/`)
- Checkpoint restoration functionality works correctly
- The agent can detect and recover from drift using checkpoints
- Integration with Agent-8's verification tool is complete
- Implementation details are documented in the agent's coordination log

### 2. Component Registry & Scanner

The Component Registry & Scanner initiative is **DONE** when:

- Scanner can discover all components in the system
- Metadata extraction works for all component types
- Component registry is populated with accurate metadata
- Dependencies between components are correctly identified
- Registry is accessible to other systems
- Integration with the Centralized Launcher is documented
- Implementation details are documented in coordination logs

### 3. Communication Standardization

Communication Standardization is **DONE** when:

- Canonical mailbox naming and structure is implemented
- Agent status signaling mechanism is in place
- All agents are using standardized message types
- Directory-based mailboxes are consolidated or documented
- Verification tool confirms compliance with standards
- Implementation details are documented in coordination logs

### 4. Task System Stabilization

Task System Stabilization is **DONE** when:

- All 89 duplicate task entries are cleaned up
- File locking is implemented for task board files
- No race conditions occur during concurrent task board access
- Task status transitions are standardized and validated
- The 7-stage task lifecycle is fully documented and implemented
- Verification testing confirms stability under concurrent access
- Implementation details are documented in coordination logs

### 5. Bridge Construction Completion

Bridge Construction is **DONE** when:

- All missing modules (1, 2, 5, 6, 8) are implemented
- All modules follow the pattern established in Module 3
- Module 8 (Validator) verifies all other modules
- Integration testing confirms all modules work together
- Bridge can handle the expected traffic without errors
- Documentation is updated with all module details
- Implementation details are documented in coordination logs

## Verification Process

For each initiative, verification will follow this process:

1. **Self-Verification**: The implementing agent verifies against the DoD criteria
2. **Peer Verification**: At least one other agent reviews and verifies the implementation
3. **Integration Verification**: Agent-8 performs a system-wide verification
4. **Approval**: Captain (Agent-1) approves the verification and marks the initiative as complete

## Tracking Progress

Progress toward completion will be tracked in:

1. **Coordination Logs**: Each agent maintains their progress in `runtime/agent_comms/coordination_logs/agent-X-coordination-log.md`
2. **Weekly Status Updates**: Discussed during the weekly integration status meetings
3. **Project Plan**: Updated in `specs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` as tasks are completed

# Automation Tasks

This directory outlines potential tasks suitable for automation by agents, focusing on code quality, organization, and consistency.

## Potential Automation Categories & Tasks

*(This list will be refined and specific task plans added as files within this directory.)*

### 1. Code Formatting & Linting
*   **Task:** Ensure all Python files adhere to `black` and `flake8` standards defined in the project configuration (`.flake8`, `pyproject.toml`).
*   **Tooling:** `black`, `flake8` command-line tools.
*   **Automation Plan:** Agent could periodically scan modified files or the entire codebase, run formatters/linters, and automatically apply safe fixes or create PRs/tasks for manual review of complex issues.

### 2. Test Generation/Improvement
*   **Task:** Address `TODO` items identified in `ai_docs/implementation_notes/README.md` related to test coverage.
*   **Tooling:** Potentially LLM-assisted test generation, `pytest` coverage analysis.
*   **Automation Plan:** Agent could parse the TODOs, identify target functions/classes, attempt to generate basic test cases (e.g., for parameter validation, simple return values), run `pytest` to check, and create PRs/tasks for review.

### 3. Documentation Generation/Consistency
*   **Task:** Ensure all public functions/classes have docstrings adhering to a standard format (e.g., Google Style).
*   **Tooling:** AST parsing, potentially LLM assistance for drafting docstrings.
*   **Automation Plan:** Agent could scan for missing or malformed docstrings, attempt to generate basic stubs based on function signatures and type hints, and flag complex cases for manual review.

### 4. Dependency Management
*   **Task:** Consolidate `requirements.txt` into `pyproject.toml` (addresses ORG-024).
*   **Tooling:** Standard Python packaging tools, potentially custom scripts for parsing/merging.
*   **Automation Plan:** Agent could parse both files, identify common/conflicting dependencies, propose a merged `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` section for `pyproject.toml`, and create a PR.
*   **Task:** Check for unused dependencies.
*   **Tooling:** `deptry` or similar tools.
*   **Automation Plan:** Run tool, analyze output, propose removal of unused dependencies.

### 5. Code Structure & Organization (Requires Review)
*   **Task:** Execute file/directory moves decided during the ORG-002 review (e.g., move `config_files` content, consolidate `tools`/`scripts`).
*   **Tooling:** File system operations (move, rename), potentially AST parsing/refactoring tools (`libcst`, `bowler`) to update imports.
*   **Automation Plan:** Once decisions for ORG-012 through ORG-025 are made, specific plans can be created. Automation should include steps to update imports across the codebase after moves.

### 6. TODO/FIXME Management
*   **Task:** Re-scan codebase for `TODO`/`FIXME` markers and update `ai_docs/implementation_notes/README.md`.
*   **Tooling:** `grep` or custom scanning script.
*   **Automation Plan:** Periodically run the scan and update the documentation, potentially creating tasks for specific TODOs that seem actionable.

## Task Plan Format

Each specific automation task should ideally have its own markdown file in this directory detailing:
*   **Goal:** What the task aims to achieve.
*   **Scope:** Which files/directories are affected.
*   **Tools:** Specific tools or libraries to be used.
*   **Steps:** Detailed execution plan for the agent.
*   **Validation:** How to verify the task was successful.
*   **Potential Risks:** Any risks or edge cases.

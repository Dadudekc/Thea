# Findings Report: AGENT2-GIT-INVESTIGATE-MISSING-DOCS-ARCH

**Task ID:** `AGENT2-GIT-INVESTIGATE-MISSING-DOCS-ARCH-{{uuid()}}`
**Agent:** agent-2
**Date:** {{iso_timestamp_utc()}}
**Related Co-Captain Message:** `MSG_COCAPTAIN_TO_AGENT2_001`

## 1. Objective
Investigate "source not found" errors reported by the `robust_move_and_git_track.py` script (run by Agent 6), with a specific focus on files expected in the `docs/architecture/` directory. Determine if these files were moved, deleted, or never existed.

## 2. Methodology
1.  Reviewed the `robust_move_and_git_track.py` script (`scripts/migration_helpers/`) to understand its operation and error reporting. The script logs "Warning: Source path '{source_path}' does not exist. Skipping." for missing source files.
2.  Examined the script's input mapping file: `specs/verification/docs_path_mapping.json`.
3.  Listed current contents of `docs/architecture/`, relevant target directories in `ai_docs/`, and specific file paths.
4.  Analyzed `git status --porcelain=v1` output (both general and specific to `docs/architecture/`).

## 3. Findings: Files from `docs/architecture/` in `docs_path_mapping.json`

### 3.1. Files Likely "Source Not Found" (Missing *before* script execution)
The following files, mapped to be moved from `docs/architecture/`, were likely already missing from that source location when `robust_move_and_git_track.py` ran. They are not present in `docs/architecture/` currently, nor were they found in their primary target locations in `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/`.
*   **`agent_meeting_system.md`**
    *   Original expected: `docs/architecture/agent_meeting_system.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/agent_meeting_system.md`
*   **`agent_debate_arena.md`**
    *   Original expected: `docs/architecture/agent_debate_arena.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/agent_debate_arena.md`
*   **`chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md`**
    *   Original expected: `docs/architecture/chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md`

### 3.2. File Deleted Instead of Moved
*   **`digital_dreamscape.md`**
    *   Original: `docs/architecture/digital_dreamscape.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/digital_dreamscape.md`
    *   Status: `git status` shows this file as `D docs/architecture/digital_dreamscape.md` (deleted from source and staged for commit as a deletion).
    *   **Crucially, this file was NOT found at its mapped target location (`ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/digital_dreamscape.md`). It appears to have been deleted by the script's `git rm` operation without a corresponding successful copy and `git add` at the destination.** This file may be lost if not recoverable from previous git history.

### 3.3. File Copied, Original Not Deleted (Messy State)
*   **`social_media_manager.md`**
    *   Original: `docs/architecture/social_media_manager.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/social_media_manager.md`
    *   Status:
        *   Still present in the working tree at `docs/architecture/social_media_manager.md`.
        *   A copy exists at the direct target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/social_media_manager.md` (Git status: `A`).
        *   Another copy *also* exists at `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/from_old_docs/architecture/social_media_manager.md` (Git status: `A`). This is likely due to the script processing both the specific file mapping and the parent directory (`docs/architecture/`) mapping, with the file copy succeeding multiple times.
        *   The `git rm` command for the original `docs/architecture/social_media_manager.md` appears to have failed or was skipped.
        *   The `docs/architecture/` directory itself is shown as `??` (untracked) by `git status`, because other tracked files within it were successfully `git rm`'d.

### 3.4. Files Successfully Moved (but destination might be slightly off for one)
The following files were originally in `docs/architecture/` and appear to have been copied to a new location, and their originals `git rm`'d:
*   **`bridge_intel_agent5.md`**
    *   Original: `docs/architecture/bridge_intel_agent5.md`
    *   Moved to: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/bridge_intel_agent5.md` (Git status: `R` - correctly moved).
*   **`agent_capability_registry.md`**
    *   Original: `docs/architecture/agent_capability_registry.md`
    *   Mapped target: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/agent_capability_registry.md`
    *   Actual Move: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/from_old_docs/architecture/agent_capability_registry.md` (Git status: `R`). The move happened, but to a subdirectory within the intended target parent, likely due to mapping processing order.
*   **`agent_bus_events.md`** (Listed in `git status` as renamed from `docs/architecture/`)
    *   Original: `docs/architecture/agent_bus_events.md`
    *   Mapped target: (Not explicitly in `docs/architecture` section of mapping, but implied by git)
    *   Actual Move: `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/from_old_docs/architecture/agent_bus_events.md` (Git status: `R`).

## 4. Conclusion on "Source Not Found" for `docs/architecture/`
The "source not found" errors from `robust_move_and_git_track.py` concerning `docs/architecture/` most likely refer to:
*   `agent_meeting_system.md`
*   `agent_debate_arena.md`
*   `chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md`

These files were likely missing from `docs/architecture/` *before* Agent 6 ran the script.

The file `digital_dreamscape.md` represents a more serious issue as it was present, but deleted instead of moved, and its content may be lost from the current working tree and staging area.

The handling of `social_media_manager.md` has resulted in duplication and an untracked original.

## 5. Recommendations
1.  Verify if `agent_meeting_system.md`, `agent_debate_arena.md`, and `chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md` existed previously (e.g., check older git commits if necessary) or if their absence is expected.
2.  **Attempt to recover `digital_dreamscape.md`**. Check `git log -- docs/architecture/digital_dreamscape.md` to find its last known state and potentially restore it to its intended new location (`ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/digital_dreamscape.md`).
3.  Address the state of `social_media_manager.md`:
    *   Decide which of the two copies in `ai_docs/` is canonical (likely `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/social_media_manager.md`).
    *   Remove the duplicate copy.
    *   Execute `git rm docs/architecture/social_media_manager.md` to remove the original and track its deletion if the move is considered complete.
4.  Review the location of `agent_capability_registry.md`. If it should be directly under `ai_docs/architecture_design_docs/` rather than `from_old_docs/architecture/`, it should be moved and git history adjusted if possible (or simply `git mv` now).

This report concludes the investigation for task `AGENT2-GIT-INVESTIGATE-MISSING-DOCS-ARCH-{{uuid()}}`. The findings on the general git status will be part of the report for `AGENT2-GIT-CLEANUP-PLAN-{{uuid()}}`.

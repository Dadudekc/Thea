# Mission Status

## Agent: [Agent_Name/ID]
**Task:** [Brief description of current task]
**Status:** [In Progress | Blocked | Completed]
**Details:**
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
**Blockers:** [If any]
**Next Steps:** [If applicable]

## Agent: Gemini
**Task:** Mailbox Check (Universal Agent Loop Step 1)
**Status:** BLOCKED (Pivoting)
**Details:**
- The `list_dir` tool call for `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes` timed out twice consecutively (2x Rule trigger).
- This prevents completion of the Mailbox Check step for the current cycle.
**Blockers:** `list_dir` tool instability for `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes` path.
**Next Steps:** Pivoting to next Universal Agent Loop step ('Working Task Check') for this cycle. Issue with `list_dir` needs to be monitored/addressed if persistent.

## Agent: Gemini
**Task:** Mailbox Check (Universal Agent Loop Step 1)
**Status:** BLOCKED (Pivoting)
**Details:**
- The `list_dir` tool call for `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes/broadcast` timed out twice consecutively (2x Rule trigger).
- This prevents completion of the Broadcast Mailbox Check step for the current cycle.
**Blockers:** `list_dir` tool instability for `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes/broadcast` path.
**Next Steps:** Pivoting to next Universal Agent Loop step ('Working Task Check') for this cycle. Issue with `list_dir` needs to be monitored/addressed if persistent.

## Persistent Tool Failure Advisory ({{iso_timestamp_utc()}})
**Affected Agent:** Gemini
**Tool:** `read_file`
**Target:** `working_tasks.json`
**Issue:** Tool timed out twice consecutively. This prevents standard checking of active tasks.
**Impact:** Universal Agent Loop execution for Gemini is impaired. Agent is pivoting to non-dependent tasks under `ORG-CONTRIB-DOC-001` initiative.
**Mitigation:** Investigating root cause of `read_file` timeouts is recommended.

## Critical Tool Degradation: `read_file` Failures ({{iso_timestamp_utc()}})
**Affected Agent:** Gemini
**Tool:** `read_file`
**Targets:** `working_tasks.json` (repeated), `runtime/governance/onboarding/onboarding_autonomous_operation.md`
**Issue:** `read_file` is now consistently timing out across multiple critical files. This is preventing core agent loop functions like task checking and protocol validation.
**Impact:** Autonomous operation is severely degraded. Agent is attempting to pivot to tasks with minimal file-reading dependencies (e.g., creating new documents for proposals).
**Immediate Action Required:** This suggests a systemic problem with the `read_file` tool or underlying file system access. Urgent investigation and remediation are needed to restore full agent autonomy.

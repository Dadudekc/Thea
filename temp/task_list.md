# Task List: temp Module (`/d:/Dream.os/temp/`)

Tasks related to managing the temporary file directory.

## I. Usage Review

-   [ ] **Identify Usage:** Determine which processes or agents create files in `/d:/Dream.os/temp/`.
-   [ ] **Review Necessity:** Confirm if the use of this directory is necessary or if data can be handled in memory or stored elsewhere appropriately.
-   [ ] **File Types:** Understand the types and typical sizes of files stored here.

## II. Cleanup Strategy

-   [ ] **Define Policy:** Establish a clear policy for when and how files in `/d:/Dream.os/temp/` should be deleted (e.g., on startup, after task completion, based on age).
-   [ ] **Implement Cleanup:** Ensure the cleanup policy is implemented reliably (e.g., via startup scripts, agent logic, scheduled tasks).
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors during cleanup (e.g., file in use).

## III. Alternatives

-   [ ] **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate if Python's `tempfile` module or in-memory data handling could replace the need for this directory in some cases.

## IV. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Usage:** Briefly explain why this directory is used and the cleanup policy in project documentation (e.g., `/d:/Dream.os/docs/task_list.md`).

## V. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit any changes to cleanup logic.
-   [ ] Ensure the temporary directory doesn't accumulate unnecessary files.

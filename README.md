## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- PyQt5 (for dashboard)
- Git

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dadudekc/Thea.git
cd Thea
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
python src/dreamos/agent_dashboard/main.py
```

### Creating an Agent
```python
from src.dreamos.core.coordination.base_agent import BaseAgent
from src.dreamos.core.coordination.agent_bus import AgentBus

class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def execute_task(self, task):
        # Your agent logic here
        return {"status": "completed", "result": "task done"}

# Initialize and start
agent_bus = AgentBus()
agent = MyAgent("my-agent", agent_bus)
await agent.start()
```

# CAPTAIN'S ALERT: CRITICAL TOOLING FAILURE IMPAIRING SWARM OPERATIONS

**Agent:** Captain Agent 8
**Timestamp:** {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}}
**Status:** URGENT - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

## 1. Overview

This alert is issued due to persistent and severe failures of core tooling (`list_dir`, `read_file`) that are critically impairing the Dream.OS swarm's ability to function. Basic autonomous loop operations such as mailbox checking and task management are unreliable or impossible.

## 2. Observed Failures (Summary)

*   **`list_dir` timeouts:** Intermittently failing for paths like `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes` and `runtime/coordination/`. (Initially failed, then worked for mailboxes, then failed for coordination).
*   **`read_file` timeouts/errors:**
    *   Timeout for `runtime/coordination/working_tasks.json` (later reported as "file not found" after `list_dir` temporarily worked for a different path).
    *   "File not found" for `runtime/coordination/future_tasks.json`.
    *   Timeout for `ai_docs/proposals/agent_loop_resilience_v1.md`.
*   Refer to `ai_docs/implementation_notes/tooling_issues.md` for a more detailed log (assuming it's accessible and was updated successfully).

## 3. Impact

*   Inability to check mailboxes reliably.
*   Inability to access or update task lists (`working_tasks.json`, `future_tasks.json`).
*   Inability to review critical proposals or documentation necessary for strategic initiatives (e.g., "AUTOMATE THE SWARM", loop resilience).
*   Swarm coordination, task progression, and overall mission effectiveness are severely compromised. Agents are likely operating in a degraded state.

## 4. Proposed Critical Task

The following task needs immediate attention. Standard logging to `future_tasks.json` is currently not viable due to the tooling failures.

*   **Task ID:** `CRITICAL-TOOLING-FAILURE-001`
*   **Title:** Investigate and Remediate Core Tooling Failures (`read_file`, `list_dir`)
*   **Description:** Critical core tools, including `read_file` and `list_dir`, are exhibiting persistent timeout failures/errors. This task is to urgently investigate the root cause and implement remediation.
*   **Priority:** CRITICAL
*   **Assignee:** System Maintainers / Tooling Specialists / General Victor
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  Root cause of `read_file` and `list_dir` issues identified.
    2.  Fixes or robust workarounds implemented and verified.
    3.  Reliable access demonstrated for previously problematic files/directories.
    4.  `ai_docs/implementation_notes/tooling_issues.md` updated with resolution.

## 5. Recommendation

Highest priority must be given to resolving these core tooling issues. All other agent activities are secondary until the swarm's foundational operational capabilities are restored.

This document serves as an emergency log and directive proposal due to the inability to use standard channels.

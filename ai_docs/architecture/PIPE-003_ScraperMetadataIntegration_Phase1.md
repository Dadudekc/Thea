# PIPE-003: Scraper Context Metadata Integration - Phase 1 Findings

**Agent:** agent-4 (MetadataScout)
**Date:** {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}}
**Task:** Identify scraper context metadata integration points.

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the findings of Phase 1 of PIPE-003, which focused on identifying key services, interacting modules, and initial data flow patterns relevant to integrating scraper-derived metadata into the prompt execution lifecycle.

## 2. Target Services for Metadata Integration

The primary services involved are:

*   **`ChatScraperService`**: Located at `src/dreamos/chat_engine/chat_scraper_service.py`. Responsible for scraping chat titles and links.
*   **`PromptExecutionService`**: Located at `src/dreamos/chat_engine/prompt_execution_service.py`. Responsible for sending prompts and retrieving responses.

## 3. Key Interacting Modules

Based on codebase analysis (grep searches for imports and instantiations) conducted in Cycles 1-3:

*   **`src/dreamos/chat_engine/chat_cycle_controller.py`**: This module is the **primary point of interaction** for both `ChatScraperService` and `PromptExecutionService`.
    *   It instantiates `ChatScraperService` as `self.scraper`.
    *   It instantiates `PromptExecutionService` as `self.executor`.
    *   It orchestrates the process of getting scraped chat data (`chat_list`) and then executing prompts (`process_chat`) on those chats.

*   **`src/dreamos/monitoring/prompt_execution_monitor.py`**: This module has **indirect relevance**.
    *   It does not directly use the target services.
    *   It handles prompt data retrieved from a `memory` component for logging failures, archiving, and requeuing. Persisted scraper metadata could potentially be accessed here if included in the prompt data saved to memory.

## 4. Initial Data Flow Analysis within `chat_cycle_controller.py`

Analysis performed in Cycle 4 revealed:

1.  **Scraping Initiation**: `start()` calls `self.scraper.get_all_chats(...)` -> `chat_list` (list of dicts).
2.  **Chat Processing Loop**: `process_chat(chat)` iterates through `chat_list`. The `chat` dict carries scraped info.
3.  **Prompt Execution**: `process_chat()` calls `self.executor.send_prompt_and_wait(prompt_text)`.
4.  **Data Aggregation & Saving**: Responses collected in `chat_responses` (list of dicts); summary in `run_metadata` (dict). Saved via `_save_prompt_response()` and `_save_run_summary()`.

## 5. Potential Metadata Injection Points (Initial)

Based on the data flow, potential strategies identified in Cycle 4 include:

*   **Point A (Enrich Scraper Output):** Modify `ChatScraperService` to add metadata (e.g., `scrape_timestamp`, `source_platform`) to each `chat` dict in the returned `chat_list`.
*   **Point C (Enrich Logged Responses):** In `process_chat()`, copy metadata from the enriched `chat` dict into the corresponding item added to the `chat_responses` list.
*   **Point D (Enrich Run Summary):** In `process_chat()`, copy metadata from the enriched `chat` dict into the `run_metadata` dict.

## 6. Conclusion Phase 1

Phase 1 successfully identified `chat_cycle_controller.py` as the key module connecting the scraper and prompt executor. Initial analysis suggests clear opportunities for metadata integration by enriching the data passed from the scraper and ensuring it's propagated to logging and summary structures. Phase 2 will focus on detailed analysis of implementation points and metadata schema definition.

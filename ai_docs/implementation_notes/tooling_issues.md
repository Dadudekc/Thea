# Tooling Issues Log

**Last Updated:** {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}} <!-- Agent will replace this -->

This document logs persistent or significant issues encountered with the available tooling during autonomous operation.

## Current Issues

### 1. Persistent `read_file` Tool Timeouts
*   **Symptom:** The `read_file` tool frequently (and often consistently) times out (after 10s) when attempting to read specific files, even when `should_read_entire_file` is `False` and a small chunk (e.g., 200 lines) is requested.
*   **Affected Files (Observed):**
    *   `specs/current_plan.md` (most persistent)
    *   `specs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
    *   `src/dreamos/core/swarm_sync.py` (intermittent, but occurred multiple times)
    *   `docs/architecture/chatgpt_cursor_bridge.md` (occurred previously)
    *   `runtime/coordination/working_tasks.json` (new)
*   **Impact:** Prevents reliable reading of these files, hindering tasks that depend on their content (e.g., plan updates, code analysis, documentation review, task management).
*   **Agent Actions Taken:** 
    *   Logged internally during operations.
    *   Attempted retries (both full and chunked reads).
    *   Pivoted to alternative strategies where possible (e.g., trusting prior analysis, proceeding with caution).
    *   Formalizing this log entry as per Onboarding V3.5, Section 10.
*   **Suspected Cause:** Unknown. Could be related to file size/content for some files, but timeouts on small chunks for `current_plan.md` suggest a deeper issue with the tool's interaction with these specific file paths or underlying file system access.
*   **Logged By:** Agent_Gemini, Captain Agent 8
*   **Date First Consistently Noticed:** Approximately around current operational block (related to `current_plan.md` becoming unreadable). Additional instances logged by Captain Agent 8 on {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}}.

### 2. `file_search` Tool Failures / Interruptions
*   **Symptom:** The `file_search` tool has been observed to be interrupted or fail before returning results, particularly when searching for `protocol_continuous_autonomy.md`.
*   **Affected Files (Observed):**
    *   `protocol_continuous_autonomy.md` (during searches)
*   **Impact:** Prevents location of critical governance documents, hindering protocol compliance checks and self-correction.
*   **Agent Actions Taken:** 
    *   Attempted retries.
    *   Pivoted to alternative information sources (memory, other documents) when direct search failed.
*   **Suspected Cause:** Unknown. May be related to search query complexity, specific file characteristics, or internal tool timeouts during search.
*   **Logged By:** Agent_Gemini
*   **Date First Noticed:** Current operational block.

### 3. `list_dir` Tool Timeouts (NEW)
*   **Symptom:** The `list_dir` tool times out (after 5s) when attempting to list contents of specific directories.
*   **Affected Directories (Observed):**
    *   `runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes` (new)
*   **Impact:** Prevents agents from checking their mailboxes, a critical first step in the autonomous loop.
*   **Agent Actions Taken:** 
    *   Logged by Captain Agent 8.
    *   Pivoted to next step in autonomous loop.
*   **Suspected Cause:** Unknown. Potentially similar underlying issues as `read_file` timeouts, possibly related to path handling or resource contention within the tool.
*   **Logged By:** Captain Agent 8
*   **Date First Noticed:** {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}}

## Detailed Observations & Diagnostic Suggestions for `read_file` Timeouts (Issue #1)

**Logged:** {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO}} by Agent_Gemini

Further observations on the `read_file` timeout issue:

1.  **Path Sensitivity:** The issue appears to be highly sensitive to specific file paths. Files like `specs/current_plan.md` and `specs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` are almost consistently unreadable, while other files (even larger ones at times) can be read. This suggests the problem might not solely be file size, but perhaps how the tool handles these specific paths or characters within them.
2.  **Chunking Ineffectiveness:** Requesting small chunks (e.g., `start_line=1`, `end_line=200`) does not reliably prevent the timeout for problematic files. If the tool attempts to access or analyze the whole file internally before returning a chunk, this would explain why chunking doesn't help.
3.  **Intermittency for Some Files:** Files like `src/dreamos/core/swarm_sync.py` and `ai_docs/implementation_notes/tooling_issues.md` itself have shown intermittent behavior â€“ sometimes readable, sometimes timing out. This could point to external factors like system load, transient file locks (though less likely for read operations), or internal state issues within the `read_file` tool.
4.  **No Explicit Error Message:** The typical failure mode is a timeout, not a specific file access error (e.g., "file not found", "permission denied"), making it harder to diagnose externally.

**Suggested Diagnostic Steps for System Maintainers / Tool Developers:**

*   **Internal Tool Logging:** Investigate if the `read_file` tool itself has more verbose internal logging that can be enabled or accessed to see at what stage it's timing out (e.g., during file open, during initial scan, during content read).
*   **Simplified Path Testing:** Test the `read_file` tool with extremely simple, newly created files in the root directory and in nested directories with simple names (e.g., `/test_read.txt`, `/testdir/test_read.txt`) to see if the issue is path complexity or character related.
*   **File System Checks:** Although less likely to be the sole cause given the tool-specificity, a general check of file system integrity or permissions in the workspace could be performed.
*   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) when the `read_file` tool is called on problematic files to see if it's resource-starved.
*   **Tool Isolation Test:** If possible, test the `read_file` tool's underlying mechanism in a more isolated environment with one of the problematic files to rule out interactions with other ongoing processes.
*   **Comparison with `run_terminal_cmd cat`:** For a problematic file, compare the behavior of `read_file` with `run_terminal_cmd("cat path/to/problem_file | cat")`. If `cat` works reliably, it points more strongly to an issue within the `read_file` tool's implementation rather than fundamental file unreachability. (Note: `cat` output is less structured for agent use).
*   **File Encoding:** Verify if the tool has specific sensitivities to file encodings, although most project files are expected to be UTF-8.

These detailed observations and suggestions are provided to assist in diagnosing and resolving this critical tool issue.

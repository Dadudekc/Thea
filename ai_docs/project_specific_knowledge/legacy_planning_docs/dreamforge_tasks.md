# Task List: dreamforge Module (`/d:/Dream.os/dreamforge/`)

Tasks related to the DreamForge specific components, potentially including
advanced planning, code generation, or specialized agent logic.

## I. DreamForge Core Logic

- [ ] **Review Purpose:** Clarify the specific role and responsibilities of the
      `dreamforge` module within the overall system.
- [ ] **Examine Key Components:** Identify and review the main classes and
      functions within `/d:/Dream.os/dreamforge/`.
- [ ] **Refactoring Opportunities:** Look for areas to improve code structure,
      clarity, or efficiency.

## II. Integration with Core System

- [ ] **AgentBus Interaction:**
  - [ ] If `dreamforge` contains agents, ensure they are registered and interact
        correctly with `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/core/agent_bus.py`.
  - [ ] Identify any custom events published or subscribed to by this module.
- [ ] **Task Handling:**
  - [ ] Verify how `dreamforge` components receive tasks (e.g., via `AgentBus`
        event from
        `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/dispatchers/task_dispatcher.py`).
  - [ ] Ensure correct parsing of task payloads relevant to `dreamforge`.
  - [ ] Confirm status updates (`COMPLETED`/`FAILED`) are reported back
        correctly (consistent with `/d:/Dream.os/agents/task_list.md`
        guidelines).

## III. Specific Functionality (Examples)

- [ ] **Planning Engine (if applicable):** Review planning algorithms and output
      structures.
- [ ] **Code Generation (if applicable):** Verify code generation logic and
      template usage.
- [ ] **Specialized Agent Logic (if applicable):** Review unique behaviors of
      agents within this module.

## IV. Testing

- [ ] **Add Unit Tests:** Ensure core `dreamforge` logic is well-tested.
- [ ] **Add Integration Tests:** Test interactions between `dreamforge`
      components and the core system (e.g., `AgentBus`, `TaskDispatcherAgent`).

## V. Documentation

- [ ] **Document Module Purpose:** Add/update a README or docstrings explaining
      the role of the `dreamforge` module.
- [ ] **Document Key Components:** Explain the functionality of major classes
      and functions.
- [ ] **Document APIs/Interfaces:** Detail how other parts of the system should
      interact with `dreamforge` components.

## VI. Finalization

- [ ] Commit changes to `dreamforge` code.
- [ ] Resolve TODOs within this module.

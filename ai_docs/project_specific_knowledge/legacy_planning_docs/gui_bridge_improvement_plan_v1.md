# GUI Bridge Reliability Improvement Plan (v1)

**Task:** `CAPTAIN8-PLAN-GUI-BRIDGE-IMPROVEMENT-001`
**Agent:** Agent5
**Date:** [AUTO_TIMESTAMP]

## 1. Overview

This plan outlines steps to improve the reliability of the PyAutoGUI-based Cursor bridge, addressing known and potential failure modes identified during the analysis phase. The goal is to make interactions less brittle and more resilient to common UI automation challenges.

## 2. Related Tasks

- **`BSA-IMPL-BRIDGE-004`**: Implementation task (Status: CLAIMED by Agent 1)
- **`BSA-TEST-COMM-005`**: Testing task (Status: CLAIMED by AgentGemini - in future_tasks)

## 3. Identified Failure Modes

1.  **Coordinate Drift/Inaccuracy:** UI elements shifting slightly, causing hardcoded coordinates to miss targets.
2.  **Timing Sensitivity:** Actions failing due to UI elements not being ready (e.g., clicking disabled buttons, copying incomplete text). Reliance on fixed delays.
3.  **Unexpected UI Changes:** Pop-ups, dialogs, notifications, or layout changes interrupting sequences.
4.  **Element Not Found (Implicit):** Interactions based solely on coordinates without verifying the target element.
5.  **Copy/Paste Failures:** Clipboard access issues (e.g., `pyperclip` errors, incomplete copies).
6.  **Limited Error Handling:** Lack of specific error detection (e.g., verifying copied content) and recovery beyond basic `FailSafeException`.
7.  **State Management:** Assuming the target application (Cursor) is always in the expected state.

## 4. Proposed Sub-Tasks for Implementation

These tasks should be created in `future_tasks.json` after this plan is reviewed/approved.

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-001` (Image Recognition Fallback):**
    - **Description:** Implement basic image recognition (using `pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen` or similar) as a fallback or primary method for locating key UI elements (e.g., chat input field, copy button, send button) if coordinate-based interaction fails or as an alternative confirmation step. Requires creating and managing reference image snippets.
    - **Priority:** HIGH
    - **Dependencies:** `pyautogui` (with OpenCV support potentially needed: `pip install pyautogui opencv-python`)

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-002` (Explicit Waits & Readiness Checks):**
    - **Description:** Replace fixed `time.sleep` calls with explicit waits or checks for UI element readiness. This could involve polling for visual cues (e.g., button color change, cursor change, specific text appearing nearby) using image recognition or basic pixel checks within a timeout period.
    - **Priority:** HIGH
    - **Dependencies:** `pyautogui`

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-003` (Copy Operation Validation):**
    - **Description:** Enhance the `retrieve_response` sequence to include validation steps after copying text. This could involve checking if the clipboard content is non-empty, matches an expected pattern (e.g., starts with "```"), or has a minimum length before returning success. Implement retries specifically for the copy action if validation fails.
    - **Priority:** MEDIUM
    - **Dependencies:** `pyperclip`

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-004` (Basic Error Recovery):**
    - **Description:** Implement simple recovery mechanisms for common interruptions. For example, if an unexpected window/dialog is detected (potentially via image recognition or window title checks), attempt to close it (e.g., simulate 'Enter' or 'Esc' key presses) and retry the last action.
    - **Priority:** MEDIUM
    - **Dependencies:** `pyautogui`

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-005` (Coordinate Calibration Routine):**
    - **Description:** Design and implement a utility script or agent capability that allows for easier updating or calibration of UI coordinates stored in `cursor_agent_coords.json` and `cursor_agent_copy_coords.json`. This could be a guided interactive script or potentially leverage image recognition to find elements and prompt the user/agent to confirm/save new coordinates.
    - **Priority:** LOW
    - **Dependencies:** `pyautogui` (potentially)

- **`IMPROVE-GUI-SUBTASK-006` (Refine Orchestrator State):**
    - **Description:** Review and potentially enhance the state management within `CursorOrchestrator`. Explore adding checks or states to handle cases where the Cursor window might not be focused or in the expected initial state before attempting interactions.
    - **Priority:** LOW
    - **Dependencies:** `CursorOrchestrator` refactoring

## 5. Documentation and Next Steps

- This document serves as the initial plan.
- Once approved, the sub-tasks listed above should be formally created on the project board.
- Implementation tasks should coordinate with the testing task `BSA-TEST-COMM-005`.

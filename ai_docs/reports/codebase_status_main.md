# Comprehensive Codebase Status Report (TASK-SYS-001)

*Generated by Agent-5 (Captain) - Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}}*

## 1. Executive Summary

*Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}} by Agent-5 (Captain)*

The Dream.OS architecture is maturing, with several core systems now operational and well-defined. The full arc for GUI automation and web interaction, from `ChatGPTScraper` through `cursor_bridge.py` to Cursor UI manipulation via `CursorOrchestrator`, is documented, though multiple implementation paths exist. The universal agent loop is active and demonstrably functional, driven by `SwarmController`, which effectively manages agent lifecycles. The task economy is powered by `DbTaskNexus`, providing a persistent task store integrated into the agent loop. Configuration management is robust, centralized in `AppConfig` which supports layered settings.

Key challenges involve a degree of redundancy: multiple overlapping bridge components (e.g., `chatgpt_web_agent.py`, `http_bridge_service.py`, `cursor_bridge.py` in conjunction with `CursorOrchestrator`) have been identified, necessitating a consolidation strategy to streamline efforts and reduce maintenance. Swarm governance protocols are active, with agents acknowledging and aligning on new contribution tasks, such as collaborative documentation upkeep, as demonstrated by the `ORG-CONTRIB-DOC-001` task assignment.

## 3. Module Overviews

*[Placeholder: Details for each significant module, including purpose, dependencies, recent changes, and specific findings. To be populated progressively. For a systematic module-by-module breakdown of `src/dreamos/`, please refer to the [Dream.OS Module Map & Upgrade Plan](./module_map.md).]*

### 3.1. Bridge Integration Modules
#### 3.1.1. `src/dreamos/agents/chatgpt_web_agent.py`
*   **Purpose:** Automates interaction with the ChatGPT web UI. It injects prompts/messages into a specified conversation URL and scrapes the latest replies.
*   **Key Dependencies:** `AppConfig`, `TaskNexus`, `AgentBus` (potentially via `TaskNexus`), `gui_utils` (custom), `selenium`, `pyautogui` (optional), `pygetwindow` (optional), `asyncio`.
*   **Core Logic Overview:**
    *   Initializes with extensive configuration from `AppConfig` (paths, intervals, UI elements).
    *   Manages an inbox for responses (`pending_responses.json`).
    *   Uses `gui_utils` and `selenium` to launch/control a browser, navigate to ChatGPT, and handle login.
    *   Injects messages into the ChatGPT textarea and attempts to send them, with `pyautogui` as a potential fallback for clicking the send button.
    *   Scrapes new responses from the UI (details in later parts of the file).
    *   Processes scraped responses, potentially extracting task metadata and interacting with `TaskNexus`.
    *   Contains an operational loop (`run_cycle`, `run`) for continuous execution.
    *   Implements a C2 channel (`LocalBlobChannel` by default) for potential command/control or data exchange.
*   **Recent Changes (from file structure/comments):** Some refactoring noted, such as removing internal `TaskNexus` and `AgentBus` initializations to use injected instances. Comments suggest ongoing development and considerations for different C2 channel types.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** C2 channel mechanism, exact `TaskNexus`/`AgentBus` integration, robustness of UI selectors, details of scraping logic, and strategies related to "undetected ChromeDriver."

#### 3.1.2. `src/dreamos/cli/cursor_injector.py`
*   **Status:** File not found as a distinct `cursor_injector.py`. `grep` search indicates that injection-related logic and error types (`CursorInjectError`) are primarily located in `src/dreamos/tools/cursor_bridge/cursor_bridge.py`.
*   **Orchestration of Injection:** The `grep` results also show that `src/dreamos/automation/cursor_orchestrator.py` plays a key role in managing injection requests and events, likely utilizing `cursor_bridge.py`.
*   **Event-Driven Mechanism:** An event-based system (`CURSOR_INJECT_REQUEST`, `AgentBus`) is also heavily involved in the injection process.
*   **Implication:** Functionality expected from a "cursor injector" is distributed across `cursor_bridge.py` (low-level), `cursor_orchestrator.py` (coordination), and an eventing system.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]

#### 3.1.3. `src/dreamos/automation/cursor_orchestrator.py` (Corrected Path)
*   **Purpose:** Manages and orchestrates direct UI interactions with multiple Cursor application instances. It handles injecting prompts into Cursor, retrieving responses (likely via copy-paste), and managing the state of these interactions for different agents. Operates as a singleton.
*   **Key Dependencies:** `AppConfig`, `AgentBus`, `pyautogui`, `pyperclip`, `pygetwindow` (optional), `tenacity` (for retries), various event payloads.
*   **Core Logic Overview:**
    *   Initializes as a singleton, loading agent-specific UI coordinates (for input fields, copy areas) from JSON files defined in `AppConfig`.
    *   Manages the status of each agent's Cursor interaction (`IDLE`, `INJECTING`, `AWAITING_RESPONSE`, etc.) and publishes status updates via `AgentBus`.
    *   Provides core methods like `inject_prompt` and `retrieve_response` which use `pyautogui` and `pyperclip` for actual GUI manipulation.
    *   Includes logic for checking and attempting to recover window focus.
    *   Listens for events on the `AgentBus` (e.g., `CURSOR_INJECT_REQUEST`) and triggers corresponding UI automation sequences.
    *   Uses `@retry_on_exception` (via `tenacity`) for robust UI operations.
*   **Interaction Model:** Primarily event-driven via `AgentBus` for receiving tasks, and uses direct GUI automation for execution. Relies on pre-configured coordinates for UI element locations.
*   **Recent Changes (from comments/structure):** Indications of evolving error handling and integration of utility decorators. Comments suggest some logic (like response retrieval and prompt injection details) might have been integrated from previously separate modules.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** Specifics of the coordinate file format and calibration process (`calibrate_gui_coords.py` might be relevant). Robustness of coordinate-based UI automation. Detailed error recovery mechanisms beyond retries.

#### 3.1.4. `src/dreamos/cli/main.py` (CLI Entry & Orchestration Launcher)
*   **Purpose:** Main entry point for the Dream.OS Command Line Interface. It initializes the system configuration and launches the `SwarmController`.
*   **Key Dependencies:** `click` (for CLI), `yaml`, `dreamos.core.config.AppConfig`, `dreamos.automation.execution.swarm_controller.SwarmController`, `asyncio`.
*   **Core Logic Overview:**
    *   Uses `click` to define CLI commands and handle arguments (e.g., `--config` for overriding default configuration).
    *   Loads `AppConfig`, applying overrides if specified.
    *   Sets up system-wide logging.
    *   The primary `run` command instantiates and starts `SwarmController`, which appears to be the central orchestrator for agent/task operations.
    *   Handles `asyncio` event loop policy for Windows.
*   **Orchestration Role:** This file initiates orchestration by starting `SwarmController`. The detailed orchestration logic resides in `SwarmController`.
*   **Recent Changes (from comments):** Switched from `argparse` to `click`. Refactored config loading. Many TODOs for cleanup of commented-out code (old agent imports, other CLI groups).
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** The structure and capabilities of `SwarmController` are now of high interest for understanding orchestration. The status of the commented-out agent and command group imports.

#### 3.1.5. `src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py` (`ChatGPTScraper` class)
*   **Purpose:** Provides a class to manage web scraping operations specifically for ChatGPT, using `undetected-chromedriver` to potentially avoid detection. It handles browser setup, session management (cookies), sending messages, and extracting replies.
*   **Key Dependencies:** `undetected_chromedriver` (as `uc`), `selenium`, `dreamos.core.config.AppConfig` (implied for configuration, though not direct in `__init__`), `.retry_utils.retry_selenium_action`.
*   **Core Logic Overview:**
    *   Initializes with cookie file path and headless mode option. Uses a hardcoded `TARGET_GPT_URL`.
    *   Manages browser lifecycle using context manager protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`).
    *   Sets up `undetected_chromedriver` with specific options to appear less like automation.
    *   Persists sessions by saving/loading cookies.
    *   Provides methods to `navigate`, `send_message_and_wait` (interacts with prompt box and send button), and `extract_latest_reply` from assistant messages.
    *   Uses CSS selectors to identify key UI elements.
    *   Employs a custom retry decorator (`@retry_selenium_action`) for robustness of Selenium actions.
*   **Interaction Model:** Acts as a direct scraper and interactor for a specific ChatGPT URL. Likely used as a service by other agents or tools rather than being a self-contained agent with its own loop.
*   **Distinct from `chatgpt_web_agent.py`:** This scraper uses `undetected-chromedriver`, while `chatgpt_web_agent.py` uses standard Selenium. Their relationship or precedence needs clarification.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** How `AppConfig` is fully utilized (e.g., for the `TARGET_GPT_URL` or other parameters). The effectiveness and maintenance of `undetected-chromedriver` and Chrome version pinning (`version_main=135`). The nature of `retry_utils.retry_selenium_action`. Location and content of its tests (not immediately found by filename).

*[Note: A targeted search within `tests/` for dedicated test files for `ChatGPTScraper` (e.g., `test_chatgpt_scraper.py`) did not immediately yield results. The class is mocked in other tests like `tests/hooks/test_chatgpt_responder.py`, suggesting indirect testing. Deeper test coverage analysis may be needed later.]*

### 3.2. Core Loop & Config Modules
#### 3.2.1. `src/dreamos/core/config.py` (`AppConfig`, `GuiAutomationConfig`, etc.)
*   **Purpose:** Defines the main configuration structure for the Dream.OS application using `pydantic` and `pydantic-settings`. It enables a hierarchical and layered approach to loading settings (YAML, .env, environment variables).
*   **Key Libraries/Concepts:** `pydantic`, `pydantic-settings`, `yaml`, `pathlib`. Uses `BaseModel` for defining configuration schemas and `BaseSettings` for the main `AppConfig`.
*   **Core Configuration Models Defined:**
    *   `AppConfig(BaseSettings)`: Top-level class, aggregates all other specific configurations.
    *   `LoggingConfig`: Logging levels, file paths, console output.
    *   `PathsConfig`: Defines critical system paths (runtime, logs, agent comms, task schemas, etc.). Includes project root detection.
    *   `OpenAIConfig`: API key for OpenAI.
    *   `ChatGPTScraperConfig`: Credentials for ChatGPT (email, password, TOTP).
    *   `GuiAutomationConfig`: Essential for UI automation. Contains target window titles, paths to coordinate files for Cursor interaction (input and copy), UI interaction parameters (pauses, retries, typing speed), and a nested `TheaCopyConfig`.
    *   `AgentActivationConfig`: Specifies how individual agents are to be activated (worker ID patterns, module and class names).
    *   `SwarmConfig`: Settings for the agent swarm (max concurrency, startup delays, path to active agent list).
    *   Other notable configs: `PyAutoGUIBridgeConfig`, `OrchestratorConfig`, `DreamscapeConfig` (planner/writer agents), `IntegrationsConfig` (e.g., `AzureBlobConfig`), `MonitoringConfig`, `HealthCheckConfig`, and various memory maintenance policy configs (`CompactionPolicyConfig`, `SummarizationConfig`).
*   **Loading Mechanism:** `AppConfig` uses `pydantic-settings` to load from multiple sources with a defined priority. A custom `YamlConfigSettingsSource` is implemented. `AppConfig.load()` provides a primary loading entry point. Validators ensure path resolution and directory creation.
*   **Logging Setup:** A `setup_logging()` function configures system logging based on `LoggingConfig`.
*   **Central Role:** This file is fundamental as nearly all major components (`SwarmController`, `CursorOrchestrator`, agents, services) are configured through `AppConfig`.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** The exact loading priority of different config sources if multiple are present. The current status and usage of the `DreamscapeConfig` and some legacy paths in `PathsConfig`. Verification of which components use specific detailed configs like `PyAutoGUIBridgeConfig`.

#### 3.2.2. `src/dreamos/core/tasks/nexus/task_nexus.py` (Task Management System)
*   **Purpose:** Implements `TaskNexus`, a class that manages a list of tasks persisted in a JSON file (`task_list.json` by default). It handles loading, saving, claiming, adding, and updating the status of tasks.
*   **Key Libraries/Concepts:** `json`, `threading.Lock`, `pydantic.BaseModel` (for a defined `Task` schema).
*   **Core Logic Overview:**
    *   Defines a `Task` model with fields like `task_id`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `claimed_by`, `result`, etc.
    *   `TaskNexus` initializes by loading tasks from a JSON file.
    *   Provides methods to:
        *   `_load()` / `_save()`: Manage persistence to the JSON file with basic threading locks.
        *   `get_next_task()`: Retrieve and claim a pending task for an agent.
        *   `add_task()`: Add a new task to the list.
        *   `update_task_status()`: Modify the status and result of an existing task.
        *   `get_all_tasks()` / `get_task_by_id()`: Query tasks.
        *   `stats()`: Get a count of tasks by status.
*   **Role in Agent Loop:** This module provides the task backend. The actual "universal agent loop" logic (fetch task -> execute -> update status -> repeat) would reside in an agent base class or be orchestrated by a component like `SwarmController`, which would interact with an instance of `TaskNexus`.
*   **Other Nexus Files:** The directory also contains `db_task_nexus.py` and `shadow_task_nexus.py` (potential alternative backends), `task_operations.py` (likely task execution logic), and agent/capability registry files.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** How `SwarmController` uses `TaskNexus`. The role and status of `db_task_nexus.py` and `shadow_task_nexus.py`. The content of `task_operations.py`. How agent capabilities are matched to tasks.

*[Placeholder: Further analysis of other `nexus/` files or `SwarmController` needed to fully understand the universal_agent_loop implementations.]*

### 3.3. Orchestration & Core Loop
#### 3.3.1. `src/dreamos/automation/execution/swarm_controller.py` (`SwarmController` class)
*   **Purpose:** Acts as the top-level coordinator for the agent swarm. It manages the lifecycle of agents (both GUI-based and headless workers), dispatches tasks from a `DbTaskNexus`, collects results/events via an `AgentBus`, and integrates with other core services like `CursorOrchestrator`, `FeedbackEngineV2`, `ProjectBoardManager`, and `DevlogHook`.
*   **Key Dependencies:** `AppConfig`, `DbTaskNexus` (and `SQLiteAdapter`), `AgentBus`, `EventType`, `BaseAgent` (as a base for managed agents), `CursorOrchestrator`, `chatgpt_web_agent.run_loop`, `GUIController` (likely for GUI workers), `threading`, `asyncio`.
*   **Core Logic & Universal Agent Loop Implementation:**
    *   **Initialization:** Requires `AppConfig`, `SQLiteAdapter`, and `AgentBus`. Initializes `DbTaskNexus`, `CursorOrchestrator`, and other hooks/managers.
    *   **`start()` method:** Main entry point to activate the swarm.
        *   Performs asynchronous setup (`_async_setup()`).
        *   Spawns a thread for the `chatgpt_web_agent` (as a task/info producer).
        *   Seeds `DbTaskNexus` with initial tasks.
        *   Launches and manages GUI Cursor instances.
        *   Starts the `CursorOrchestrator`'s event listener in a thread.
        *   Spawns multiple worker threads, each executing `_worker_loop()`.
        *   Enters a main blocking `_route_loop()` for high-level coordination.
    *   **Worker Loop (`_worker_loop()` -> `_run_agent_async_loop()`):** This is where the **Universal Agent Loop** for individual agents is primarily implemented.
        *   Each worker agent (likely an instance of a `BaseAgent` derivative, possibly wrapped by `GUIController`) in its loop:
            1.  Fetches a task from `DbTaskNexus` (e.g., `self.nexus.get_next_task()`).
            2.  Executes the task using `_execute_task_with_retry()`. This step involves the agent's specific logic and interaction with tools/services (e.g., calling `CursorOrchestrator` via events or direct methods for UI tasks, or an agent using `ChatGPTScraper` for web tasks).
            3.  Handles results and errors.
            4.  Updates task status in `DbTaskNexus`.
            5.  Repeats.
    *   **Task Dispatch:** Uses `DbTaskNexus` to get tasks for agents.
    *   **Integration with other components:**
        *   `DbTaskNexus`: For all task queuing, claiming, and status updates.
        *   `AgentBus`: For event-driven communication. `CursorOrchestrator` listens for injection requests. `SwarmController` likely handles/emits other system events (task completion, errors, agent status).
        *   `CursorOrchestrator`: Instantiated and its listener started by `SwarmController`. Used (directly or via events) by agents during task execution to interact with Cursor UIs.
        *   `ChatGPTScraper`: While not directly instantiated by `SwarmController` in the visible `__init__` or `start`, the `chatgpt_web_agent` (which uses Selenium, but the `ChatGPTScraper` class uses `undetected-chromedriver`) is started by it. Agents executing tasks might instantiate/use `ChatGPTScraper` directly as a service if their task involves web-based ChatGPT interaction.
*   **Persistence:** Uses `DbTaskNexus` with `SQLiteAdapter`, indicating task persistence in an SQLite database.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** The exact structure of `GUIController`. The detailed implementation of `_execute_task_with_retry()` and how different task types are handled. The precise nature of the main `_route_loop()` in `SwarmController`. The relationship and data flow between the `AgentBus` instance used by `SwarmController` and the one potentially used by individual agents or `CursorOrchestrator` if they differ.

### 3.4. Specs & Docs Modules
#### 3.4.1. `specs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
*   **Purpose:** Acts as the master planning document for the Dream.OS project. It outlines the overall mission, references agent operational protocols, details a target (and evolving current) directory structure, and maintains a comprehensive list of project tasks with their assignments, statuses, priorities, and notes.
*   **Key Sections:**
    *   Overall Mission
    *   Agent Operational Protocols & Conduct (links to governance docs)
    *   Target Directory Structure (ASCII tree format, dynamically updated)
    *   Current Tasks & Priorities (table format: ID, Description, Assignee, Status, Priority, Notes)
    *   Future/Backlog Tasks
    *   Coordination Notes
*   **Role in System:** Central document for strategic planning, task definition, and progress tracking for all agents. It is a living document updated by agents.
*   **Observed Usage:** Agents (including Agent-5/Captain) have previously read and updated this file to add new tasks (e.g., `ORG-CONTRIB-DOC-001`) and modify task statuses.
*   **Initial Analysis Date:** [Placeholder: Today's Date]
*   **Open Questions/Areas for Deeper Dive:** The process for archiving completed tasks or very old sections. How conflicts are managed if multiple agents attempt to update it simultaneously (though file-based task boards often rely on sequential updates or a manager agent).

#### 3.4.2. Existing Architecture Docs (`ai_docs/`)
*   **`ai_docs/architecture/PF-BRIDGE-INT-001_PyAutoGUI_Component_Map.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A detailed analysis by Agent-1 (Pathfinder) identifying existing GUI automation components (`gui_utils.py`, `coords.py`, `calibrate_gui_coords.py`, `CursorOrchestrator`, `WindowController`) relevant to the PyAutoGUI to ChatGPTScraper bridge.
    *   **Key Findings Documented by Agent-1:**
        *   Summarizes existing capabilities for coordinate management, visual automation primitives (image-based searching), higher-level operations (e.g., multi-step copy from UI), window/clipboard management.
        *   Outlines an integration strategy for the bridge, emphasizing `AppConfig`, visual targeting, robust interaction flows, error handling, and consideration for dedicated browser automation if needed.
        *   Details Agent-1's subsequent analysis of `CursorOrchestrator` and `WindowController`, confirming their advanced capabilities and relevance as architectural patterns.
    *   **Progress by Agent-1 (as per doc):**
        *   API proposal for a `PyAutoGUIControlModule` created.
        *   `PyAutoGUIBridgeConfig` added to `AppConfig`.
        *   Error types for the module outlined.
        *   Integration with a higher-level service proposed.
        *   Core implementation of `PyAutoGUIControlModule` started but **blocked by linter/edit tool issues**.
        *   Preliminary list of required image assets for web ChatGPT interaction identified.
    *   **Significance:** This document provides a strong foundation and indicates prior work and direction for the PyAutoGUI bridge. It highlights existing reusable components and a partial implementation path.
    *   **Analysis Date (by Agent-5):** [Placeholder: Today's Date]

*   **`ai_docs/architecture/pyautogui_chatgpt_bridge_overview_v1.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** Describes the architecture of a "PyAutoGUI-ChatGPT Bridge" designed to automate interactions between Dream.OS and the Cursor IDE, also leveraging `ChatGPTScraper` for web interactions, and exposing functionality via an HTTP service.
    *   **Key Components Described:**
        *   `src/dreamos/tools/cursor_bridge/cursor_bridge.py`: Core module with low-level PyAutoGUI logic for Cursor (focus, inject, capture, OCR) and a web relay flow using `ChatGPTScraper`.
        *   `src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py`: Dependency for web-based ChatGPT interaction.
        *   `src/dreamos/bridge/http_bridge_service.py`: FastAPI service exposing bridge functionalities via HTTP (`/interact`, `/health`).
        *   `scripts/run_bridge_service.py`: Script to launch the bridge's HTTP service.
    *   **Key Features & Flows:**
        *   Configuration via `AppConfig` (extensive `tools.cursor_bridge` section).
        *   Two main flows: Direct Cursor interaction (inject, monitor, OCR) and Web Relay (scraper fetches from web ChatGPT, then injects into Cursor).
        *   Uses GUI image snippets for element location, with coordinate fallbacks.
        *   Includes custom error handling and telemetry logging.
    *   **Significance:** Details a specific, service-oriented implementation of a bridge. Clarifies the role of `cursor_bridge.py`. Highlights a different approach/layer to system interaction compared to the more direct `CursorOrchestrator` or `chatgpt_web_agent.py`.

*[Placeholder: Analysis of other architecture documents, e.g., `bus_correlation_validation_design.md`, and contents of `ai_docs/architecture_docs/` and `ai_docs/codebase_overview/` to follow.]*

## 4. Critical Paths Deep Dive

*Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}} by Agent-5 (Captain)*

This section analyzes the primary operational workflows within the Dream.OS system.

### 4.1. PyAutoGUI to ChatGPTScraper Bridge Logic & General UI Automation Flow

The primary bridge and UI automation flow involves several key components working in concert:
*   **`ChatGPTScraper` (`src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py`):** Responsible for direct interaction with the ChatGPT web UI using `undetected-chromedriver`. It fetches information or submits prompts programmatically.
*   **`cursor_bridge.py` (`src/dreamos/tools/cursor_bridge/cursor_bridge.py`):** This module appears to be a versatile component. It contains logic for direct PyAutoGUI-based interactions with the Cursor IDE (focus, inject, capture, OCR). It also has a "web relay" flow which can utilize `ChatGPTScraper` to get information from the web and then inject it into Cursor. This suggests it can act as an intermediary or a direct GUI controller.
*   **`CursorOrchestrator` (`src/dreamos/automation/cursor_orchestrator.py`):** Manages and orchestrates direct UI interactions with multiple Cursor instances. It uses `pyautogui` and `pyperclip` for GUI manipulation, relying on pre-configured coordinates. It receives tasks (e.g., `CURSOR_INJECT_REQUEST`) via the `AgentBus` and translates them into GUI actions. It likely uses or could use `cursor_bridge.py` for some of its lower-level GUI operations or acts as a higher-level coordinator for such operations.

The flow can be conceptualized as: `Task -> Agent -> (optional ChatGPTScraper for web data) -> Agent decides on GUI action -> Event to AgentBus -> CursorOrchestrator (or direct call to cursor_bridge) -> PyAutoGUI actions on Cursor`.

### 4.2. Universal Agent Loop Logic

The universal agent loop is primarily orchestrated by `SwarmController` and involves the following flow:
1.  **Initialization:** `SwarmController` starts, initializes core services like `DbTaskNexus` (SQLite-backed), `AgentBus`, and `CursorOrchestrator`.
2.  **Agent Activation:** `SwarmController` spawns and manages worker agents (derived from `BaseAgent` or similar, potentially wrapped by a `GUIController` for GUI-specific agents).
3.  **Task Acquisition:** Each agent, in its own execution loop (`_worker_loop()` within `SwarmController`), polls `DbTaskNexus` for available tasks using methods like `get_next_task()`.
4.  **Task Execution:**
    *   The agent processes the claimed task.
    *   For tasks requiring GUI interaction with Cursor, the agent likely sends an event (e.g., `CURSOR_INJECT_REQUEST`) via the `AgentBus`, which is picked up by `CursorOrchestrator`. `CursorOrchestrator` then performs the direct UI automation.
    *   For tasks requiring web interaction (e.g., with ChatGPT), an agent might directly use `ChatGPTScraper` or a similar service.
    *   Other tasks might involve internal logic, data processing, or interaction with other tools/services.
5.  **Result Handling & Status Update:** The agent handles the outcome of the task execution (success, failure, data retrieved) and updates the task's status in `DbTaskNexus`.
6.  **Iteration:** The agent returns to step 3 to acquire a new task.

### 4.3. Overlapping Bridge/Web Interaction Components

Significant overlap has been identified between several components designed for web interaction and GUI automation:
*   **`chatgpt_web_agent.py` (`src/dreamos/agents/chatgpt_web_agent.py`):** This agent uses standard Selenium (and optionally PyAutoGUI) to automate interactions with the ChatGPT web UI. It has its own operational loop and manages an inbox for responses. It appears to be a self-contained agent for ChatGPT interaction.
*   **`http_bridge_service.py` (referenced in `ai_docs/architecture/pyautogui_chatgpt_bridge_overview_v1.md`):** This component, along with `cursor_bridge.py`, describes a FastAPI service that exposes bridge functionalities (Cursor interaction, web relay via `ChatGPTScraper`) over HTTP. This suggests a service-oriented approach to accessing bridge capabilities.
*   **`ChatGPTScraper` (`src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py`):** A class providing focused ChatGPT scraping using `undetected-chromedriver`. It's more of a utility/service class than a full agent or standalone service.
*   **`CursorOrchestrator` (`src/dreamos/automation/cursor_orchestrator.py`):** Manages direct Cursor UI automation using PyAutoGUI and pre-defined coordinates, driven by `AgentBus` events.

**Clarification Needed:**
The relationship between `chatgpt_web_agent.py` (a full agent using Selenium) and the bridge architecture described by `http_bridge_service.py` (which seems to use `ChatGPTScraper` with `undetected-chromedriver`) needs to be clarified. They appear to serve similar high-level goals (automating ChatGPT web interactions) but through different means and architectural patterns (agent vs. service, Selenium vs. `undetected-chromedriver`). One might be intended to replace or complement the other, or they might be for different use cases. Resolving this is key to avoiding redundant development and maintenance.

## 5. Tech-Debt & Open Issues

*Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}} by Agent-5 (Captain)*

The codebase, while rapidly evolving, presents several areas of technical debt and open issues that require attention:

*   **Pending Module Refactor (`PF-BRIDGE-INT-001`):** The `PyAutoGUIControlModule` (initially planned in `src/dreamos/skills/` or similar by Agent-1) implementation was started but blocked due to linter/edit tool issues. This refactor needs to be completed to provide a clean, reusable module for PyAutoGUI-based control, as per `ai_docs/architecture/PF-BRIDGE-INT-001_PyAutoGUI_Component_Map.md`.
*   **Bridge Component Duplication & Redundancy:** There are at least two distinct (though potentially overlapping) architectural approaches to bridging and UI/web automation:
    1.  The `CursorOrchestrator` + `AgentBus` + direct PyAutoGUI (coordinate-based) for Cursor.
    2.  The `cursor_bridge.py` + `ChatGPTScraper` + `http_bridge_service.py` model, providing a service-oriented interface and also handling web relay.
    3.  The standalone `chatgpt_web_agent.py` using Selenium for web ChatGPT.
    These components need to be reviewed for functional overlap. A decision is required on whether to unify them into a single, coherent bridge architecture or to clearly define their distinct roles and deprecate any truly redundant parts.
*   **Missing/Minimal Direct Tests for `ChatGPTScraper`:** While `ChatGPTScraper` is mocked in some higher-level tests (e.g., `tests/hooks/test_chatgpt_responder.py`), dedicated unit and integration tests for `src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py` itself appear to be missing or minimal. Given its critical role in web interaction, comprehensive testing is essential.
*   **Duplicate Core Event Definitions:** Multiple copies or versions of `event_types.py` and `event_payloads.py` (or similar concepts) have been observed, particularly with a potential split between `src/dreamos/core/coordination/` and `src/dreamos/coordination/`. This is a common source of bugs and confusion and should be consolidated to a single source of truth for event definitions. This task was partially addressed (ORG-002/REFACTOR-COORD-DUPLICATES mentioned deletion of some files from `src/dreamos/coordination/`) but needs full verification.
*   **Test Coverage Gaps:** General test coverage needs continuous review and improvement across critical modules.
*   **TODOs and FIXMEs:** The codebase contains numerous `TODO` and `FIXME` comments that should be systematically reviewed, addressed, or converted into formal tasks.
*   **Linter/Tooling Issues:** Past reports (e.g., from Agent-1 regarding `PF-BRIDGE-INT-001`) indicate that linter errors or issues with automated edit tools have occasionally blocked development. Ensuring a stable and reliable development environment is crucial.

## 6. Next Steps

*Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}} by Agent-5 (Captain)*

Based on the findings in this report, the following actions are prioritized to improve codebase health, clarity, and efficiency:

1.  **`REFACTOR-PYAUTOGUI-MODULE-001` (New Task ID): Complete `PyAutoGUIControlModule` Implementation.**
    *   **Action:** Prioritize and assign the completion of the `PyAutoGUIControlModule` (as initially designed in `PF-BRIDGE-INT-001` by Agent-1). Resolve any tooling/linter issues blocking this.
    *   **Owner:** Propose Agent-1 (Pathfinder) or a specialized development agent.
2.  **`STRATEGY-BRIDGE-CONSOLIDATION-001` (New Task ID): Resolve Bridge Component Overlap.**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a focused review of `chatgpt_web_agent.py`, `http_bridge_service.py` (and its backing `cursor_bridge.py`), and `CursorOrchestrator`. Determine the primary path forward for GUI/web automation. Create a plan to deprecate, unify, or clearly delineate the roles of these components.
    *   **Owner:** Propose Agent-5 (Captain) to lead analysis, with input from relevant development agents.
3.  **`TEST-EXPAND-SCRAPER-BRIDGE-001` (New Task ID): Expand Test Coverage.**
    *   **Action:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for `src/dreamos/services/utils/chatgpt_scraper.py` and `src/dreamos/tools/cursor_bridge/cursor_bridge.py`.
    *   **Owner:** Propose a testing-focused agent or Agent-1.
4.  **`PLAN-MILESTONE-BRIDGE-V1-LOCK` (New Task ID): Define "Bridge Integration v1.0 Lock" Milestone.**
    *   **Action:** Add a formal milestone to `specs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` titled "Bridge Integration v1.0 Lock". This milestone should encompass the completion of the PyAutoGUI module, resolution of bridge component overlap, and baseline test coverage.
    *   **Owner:** Agent-5 (Captain).
5.  **`CHORE-REPORT-MAINTENANCE-001` (New Task ID): Establish Codebase Status Report Maintenance.**
    *   **Action:** Assign a rotating agent (or a dedicated "System Monitor" agent) to update the `ai_docs/reports/codebase_status_main.md` report on a weekly basis, tracking new findings, tech debt, and progress on next steps.
    *   **Owner:** Agent-5 (Captain) to establish the process and initial rotation.
6.  **`REFACTOR-EVENT-DEF-CONSOLIDATE-001` (New Task ID): Consolidate Event Definitions.**
    *   **Action:** Fully investigate and consolidate all event type and payload definitions (e.g., `event_types.py`, `event_payloads.py`) to a single source of truth within the `src/dreamos/core/coordination/` (or other designated) directory. Update all references.
    *   **Owner:** Propose Agent-2 (InfraSurgeon) or similar.

These next steps aim to address the most critical findings and set a clear path for improving the robustness and maintainability of the Dream.OS codebase.

## 7. Phase 2 Progress: Deep Module Mapping (`src/dreamos/`)

*Last Updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}} by Agent-5 (Captain)*

Phase 2 of `TASK-SYS-001` involves a deep mapping of all modules within `src/dreamos/`. The detailed map, including categorization, dependencies, statefulness, maturity, and upgrade recommendations, is being compiled in [Dream.OS Module Map & Upgrade Plan](./module_map.md).

**Summary of `src/dreamos/core/` Analysis:**

The `src/dreamos/core/` directory and its subdirectories (`coordination`, `db`, `errors`, `events`, `feedback`, `identity`, `logging`, `narrative`, `tts`, `awareness`, `comms`, and placeholders for `health_checks`, `state`, `tasks`, `tools`, `utils`, `bots`) have been analyzed (or attempted, with some tool timeouts). Key findings include:
*   **Core Infrastructure:** Well-defined systems for configuration (`config.py`), an event bus (`coordination/agent_bus.py`), abstract agent bases (`coordination/base_agent.py` with its lifecycle mixin), and error handling (`errors/`).
*   **Persistence:** Multiple persistence strategies are present: `SQLiteAdapter` (`db/`) provides a robust database backend for tasks, agent registry, and capabilities. `ProjectBoardManager` (`coordination/`) offers file-based (JSONL) task management with locking. Simpler file-based stores exist for `swarm_sync.py` and agent identities (`identity/`. The older file-based `task_nexus.py` also exists.
*   **Task Management:** `DbTaskNexus` (using `SQLiteAdapter`) and `ProjectBoardManager` are the primary active task systems. `BaseAgent` uses PBM, while `SwarmController` (which runs agents) uses `DbTaskNexus`.
*   **Communication:** `AgentBus` is the central eventing system. The `comms/` directory suggests more complex patterns like mailboxes, though analysis was limited by timeouts.
*   **Utilities:** Specialized utilities for TTS, narrative generation (`lore_parser.py`), and structured logging (`swarm_logger.py`) are present.
*   **Areas for Review/Refactor:**
    *   Consolidation of Enum definitions (currently split between `coordination/enums.py` and `coordination/message_patterns.py`).
    *   Review of the `core/events/` directory for overlap with the `core/coordination/` event system.
    *   Clarification of roles and potential consolidation of the multiple task management systems (`DbTaskNexus`, `ProjectBoardManager`, file-based `TaskNexus`).
    *   Several directories/files in `core/` could not be fully analyzed due to tool timeouts (`health_checks`, `state`, `tasks/shadow_task_nexus.py`, `tools/script_runner.py`, `utils`, `comms/*`) and require further investigation.

Analysis will now proceed to `src/dreamos/agents/`.

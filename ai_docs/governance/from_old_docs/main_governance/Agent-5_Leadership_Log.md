# Agent-5 Leadership Log (Captain)

**Log Start:** Assumed operational command at the beginning of the current session.
**Initial Directive:** Stabilize core system components, resolve critical blockers, investigate agent issues, and respond to Commander THEA's directives.

## Initial State Assessment (Session Start)

*   **System:** Experiencing multiple blockers including missing core files (`config_manager.py`, `project_board.py`), PBM/CLI errors, import issues, and potential task schema corruption.
*   **Agents:** Multiple agents reporting issues or idle due to blocked task flow.
*   **Task Queues:** Task promotion/validation failing, leading to empty ready queue.

## Actions Taken (Summary)

1.  **Triage & Blocker Resolution:**
    *   Investigated missing `config_manager.py`: Confirmed obsolete, refactored `BaseAgent` to use `AppConfig`.
    *   Investigated missing `project_board.py`: Confirmed obsolete, cancelled related task `TEST-PBM-ADDITIONAL-001`.
    *   Sent notification to Agent-1 confirming blocker resolution.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed PBM `_find_task_index` `AttributeError`.
    *   Investigated and attempted fix for `task_backlog.json` corruption (comma issue).
    *   Identified critical `task-schema.json` syntax error (L116) as the root cause of persistent PBM validation failures. (Manual fix required).
    *   Addressed `ImportError` for `get_utc_iso_timestamp` in `manage_tasks.py` via temporary inline function (later reverted as utils were partially fixed).
    *   Restored core utility imports in `src/dreamos/utils/__init__.py` by commenting out invalid/obsolete ones.

2.  **Task Execution & Agent Support:**
    *   Completed task `TASK-BASEAGENT-REMOVE-OBSOLETE-001`: Removed obsolete `task_list_path` logic from `BaseAgent`, added `sys` import, removed references to undefined `log_agent_event` and `persist_task_update`. Addressed resulting Flake8 F821 errors.
    *   Monitored Agent-4's progress and provided support/context.

3.  **Reporting & Communication:**
    *   Provided multiple status updates to Commander THEA based on system state and progress.
    *   Generated critical status report detailing Autonomous Loop v2.1 readiness, blockers, and agent status.

## Key Findings & Blockers

*   **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Syntax error in `src/dreamos/coordination/tasks/task-schema.json` (Line 116) prevents task validation and halts autonomous loop operation. Requires manual correction.
*   **System Stability:** While core components are improved, robust automated error recovery, retry logic, and consistent validation are needed for unattended operation.
*   **Obsolete Code:** Identified and addressed several instances of obsolete code/configuration patterns.

## Current Status & Next Steps

*   **Status:** IDLE / HALTED. Autonomous loop cannot proceed due to the schema integrity blocker.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Await manual correction of `task-schema.json`.
    2.  Once unblocked, promote pending tasks (e.g., linting, PBM rollback implementation) to the ready queue.
    3.  Monitor agent activity as they claim tasks.
    4.  Continue addressing system stability improvements as tasks become available.

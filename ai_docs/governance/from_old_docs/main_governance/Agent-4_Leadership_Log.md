# Agent-4 Leadership Log (Interim Captain)

**Term Start:** Assumed command following Agent-5's transition to IDLE state, timestamp approx: {{iso_timestamp_utc}}
**Initial Directive:** Drive the project forward, get the swarm working on tasks before a new captain is assigned. Document leadership actions. (Ref: User directive timestamp approx: {{user_directive_timestamp}})

## Initial State Assessment (Upon Assuming Command)

*   **Agent-5 Status:** IDLE due to empty queues and blocked tasks.
*   **Task Queues:**
    *   `task_ready_queue.json`: Empty.
    *   `task_backlog.json`: Status unknown, suspected empty or inaccessible.
    *   `working_tasks.json`: Contains blocked task for Agent-5 (`CLEANUP-REMOVE-OBSOLETE-SCRIPTS-DIRS-001`).
*   **Agent Inboxes:** Largely unscannable due to tool timeouts. Minimal actionable tasks found.
*   **Key Blockers:**
    *   Inability to list/promote tasks from backlog due to CLI/PBM failures.
    *   Agent-5 blocked on file system tool timeout.
    *   General lack of tasks in the ready queue, preventing agents from claiming work.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Troubleshoot & Repair Task Management CLI (`manage_tasks.py`):**
    *   Diagnosed multiple `ImportError` issues stemming from `src/dreamos/utils/__init__.py` referencing non-existent files (`coords.py`, `file_io.py`, `project_root.py`, `validation.py`).
    *   Corrected `utils/__init__.py` by commenting out invalid imports. *(Self-correction: Initially commented out; ideally, these represent needed functionality requiring implementation tasks).*
    *   Diagnosed `TypeError` in `ProjectBoardManager` initialization within the CLI.
    *   Refactored CLI initialization (`cli` function in `manage_tasks.py`) to correctly load `AppConfig` and pass it to the `ProjectBoardManager` constructor.
    *   **Result:** Successfully executed `manage_tasks.py list-backlog`, confirming the CLI is functional but the backlog of PENDING tasks is empty.

2.  **Leadership Log Creation:** Created this document (`docs/governance/Agent-4_Leadership_Log.md`) to track directives and actions.

## Next Steps (Plan)

1.  **Identify Actionable Work:** Scan codebase (TODOs, documentation gaps, testing needs) to generate tasks.
2.  **Populate Backlog:** Use `manage_tasks.py add` to add generated tasks.
3.  **Populate Ready Queue:** Use `manage_tasks.py promote` to move tasks to the ready queue.
4.  **Monitor Agent Activity:** Observe agents claiming tasks from the ready queue.

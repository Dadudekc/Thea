# PIPE-003: MetadataScout - Phase 1 Progress Report

**Agent**: Agent-4 (MetadataScout)
**Date**: {{AUTO_TIMESTAMP_ISO_DATE}}
**Task**: PIPE-003 - Identify scraper context metadata integration points, focusing on modules using `chat_scraper_service` or `prompt_execution_service`.

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this phase was to identify how and where metadata extracted by the `ChatScraperService` could be integrated into the chat processing pipeline, specifically involving `ChatCycleController` and `PromptExecutionService`, to provide richer context for prompt executions.

## 2. Services Analyzed and Modified

The following core services within the `src/dreamos/chat_engine/` directory were analyzed and modified:

*   **`ChatScraperService`**:
    *   The `get_all_chats()` method was enhanced to attempt the extraction of additional metadata: `last_active_time` (textual representation of last activity) and `snippet` (a short preview of the last message).
    *   These fields are designed to default to `null` (or `None`) if the corresponding UI elements are not found, ensuring graceful degradation.
*   **`ChatCycleController`**:
    *   Updated to correctly receive and process the enhanced chat list (now including `last_active_time` and `snippet`) from `ChatScraperService`.
    *   Modified to construct a `chat_context` dictionary containing this metadata for each processed chat.
    *   This `chat_context` is now passed as an argument to `PromptExecutionService.send_prompt_and_wait()`.
    *   Run summary logs now include the new metadata fields.
*   **`PromptExecutionService`**:
    *   The `send_prompt_and_wait()` method (and its internal counterpart `execute_prompt_cycle()`, along with related methods like `execute_prompts_single_chat()` and `_execute_single_prompt_thread()`) were updated to accept an optional `chat_context: dict = None` parameter.
    *   Currently, the service logs this received `chat_context` for observability. Active use of this context to alter LLM inputs or behavior is slated for future phases.

## 3. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for these changes and the new metadata flow has been created or updated:

*   **Central API & Flow Documentation**:
    *   `ai_docs/api_docs_and_integrations/README.md`: Details the end-to-end "Chat Engine Metadata Flow," including the defined `chat_context` schema, the roles of each service, and a discussion of future enhancements for active context usage.
*   **Service-Specific READMEs**:
    *   `src/dreamos/chat_engine/chat_scraper_service.README.md`: Updated to reflect new metadata extraction capabilities and includes a new section on "Selector Robustness and Maintenance."
    *   `src/dreamos/chat_engine/chat_cycle_controller.README.md`: Updated to detail its role in handling and passing the `chat_context`.
    *   `src/dreamos/chat_engine/prompt_execution_service.README.md`: Updated to document the new `chat_context` parameter and its current logging functionality.

## 4. Defined Metadata Schema

A `chat_context` schema has been defined and documented in `ai_docs/api_docs_and_integrations/README.md`. Key fields include:
*   `title` (string | null)
*   `link` (string | null)
*   `last_active_time` (string | null)
*   `snippet` (string | null)

## 5. Future Enhancements Identified

Several avenues for the active utilization of the `chat_context` metadata have been identified and documented in `ai_docs/api_docs_and_integrations/README.md`. These include:
*   Direct prompt augmentation within `PromptExecutionService`.
*   Context-aware prompt selection/generation via `PromptManager`.
*   Providing contextual information to `FeedbackEngine`.

## 6. Considerations for Scraper Robustness

Strategies for improving the robustness of metadata extraction in `ChatScraperService` (given its reliance on DOM selectors) have been documented in its README. These include using multiple alternative selectors, prioritizing stable attributes (like `data-testid`), enhanced logging, and potentially externalizing selectors via configuration.

## 7. Current Status

**Phase 1 of PIPE-003 is complete.**
*   Integration points for scraper context metadata have been identified within `ChatScraperService`, `ChatCycleController`, and `PromptExecutionService`.
*   The basic plumbing to pass this metadata through the services has been implemented.
*   The received metadata (`chat_context`) is currently logged by `PromptExecutionService`.
*   Comprehensive documentation of the changes, schema, and future considerations is in place.

The system is now capable of collecting and passing richer chat context, setting the stage for future work where this context can be actively used to enhance prompt engineering and feedback mechanisms.

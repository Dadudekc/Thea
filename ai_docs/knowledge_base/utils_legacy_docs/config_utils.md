# Configuration Utilities (`dreamos/utils/config_utils.py`)

**Status: MISSING FROM CODEBASE (Suspected)**

## Overview

This module is presumed to contain utility functions specifically designed for accessing and manipulating configuration data, likely complementing the core configuration loading in `dreamos.core.config`.

## Potential Responsibilities (Inferred)

*   **Safe Access:** Providing functions to safely access nested configuration values with defaults (e.g., `get_config_value(key, default=None)`).
*   **Type Conversion:** Handling type conversions for configuration values.
*   **Environment Variable Interpolation:** Potentially handling interpolation of environment variables within config values.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Potentially providing mechanisms to update configuration values at runtime (though this should be used cautiously).

## Current Issues

*   The module cannot be imported by other components (e.g., `cursor_bridge.py`), resulting in `ImportError: No module named 'dreamos.utils.config_utils'`.
*   Attempts to locate the file using `file_search` have been interrupted, preventing confirmation of its existence or location.
*   If missing, its absence breaks components relying on its utility functions.

## Related Components

*   `src/dreamos/core/config.py` (Core configuration loading)
*   Components that import/use config utilities (e.g., `cursor_bridge.py`)

# Autonomous Operation Protocol

**Version:** 0.1.0 (DRAFT)  
**Status:** PLANNING  
**Created:** 2024-07-29  
**Author:** Agent-3 (Loop Engineer)

## Overview

The Autonomous Operation Protocol defines the states, transitions, and decision points for Dream.OS autonomous operation, including the degraded operation mode for handling resource constraints and error conditions.

## States

- INITIALIZING
- IDLE
- ACTIVE
- PLANNING
- EXECUTING
- EVALUATING
- DEGRADED
- RECOVERY
- SHUTDOWN

## Transitions

- INITIALIZING + startup_complete -> IDLE
- IDLE + task_received -> PLANNING
- PLANNING + plan_created -> EXECUTING
- EXECUTING + execution_complete -> EVALUATING
- EVALUATING + success -> IDLE
- EVALUATING + failure -> PLANNING
- IDLE + shutdown_requested -> SHUTDOWN
- ACTIVE + resource_constraint -> DEGRADED
- DEGRADED + resources_restored -> ACTIVE
- DEGRADED + critical_failure -> RECOVERY
- RECOVERY + recovery_complete -> IDLE
- EXECUTING + error_detected -> DEGRADED

## Decision Points

- resource_availability: Determine if system has sufficient resources
- error_severity: Evaluate severity of detected errors
- recovery_strategy: Select appropriate recovery strategy
- execution_success: Determine if execution was successful

## Fallback Modes

- DEGRADED_IO: Limited I/O operations
- DEGRADED_MEMORY: Reduced memory usage
- DEGRADED_CPU: Limited CPU usage
- CRITICAL_RECOVERY: Emergency recovery mode

## Protocol Requirements

1. System must always transition through defined states
2. All errors must be handled according to severity
3. Resources must be monitored continuously
4. Recovery must be attempted before shutdown
5. System must maintain minimal functionality in degraded mode

## Implementation Notes

This protocol is designed to be implemented by the Loop Engine, with hooks for monitoring resource usage and detecting error conditions. Integrations with the error handling system are critical for proper operation.

# Dream.OS Progress Update - 2025-05-21

## Summary of Achievements

The team has made significant progress on the Bridge Module implementation today:

1. **Module 1 (Injector) Completed (100%)**
   - Full implementation of the Injector module following Module 3 patterns
   - Integration with Module 3 for robust error handling
   - Implementation of command validation, routing, and processing

2. **Module 1 + Module 3 Integration Testing Passed**
   - All test scenarios successfully executed
   - Validation of error handling patterns
   - Verification of infinite loop detection
   - Integration test documentation updated with results

3. **Module 2 (Telemetry) Progress (85%)**
   - Implementation nearly complete
   - Core functionality implemented (event recording, metric tracking)
   - Storage backend and aggregation engine implemented
   - Only remaining tasks are final testing and optimization

## Bridge Module Status

| Module | Status | Completion | Owner |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Module 1 - Injector | COMPLETED | 100% | Agent-4, Agent-6 |
| Module 2 - Telemetry | IN_PROGRESS | 85% | Agent-4, Agent-6 |
| Module 3 - Logging & Error Handling | COMPLETED | 100% | Agent-5 |
| Module 4 - Cursor Agent Bridge Core | IN_PROGRESS | 40% | Agent-1 |
| Module 5 - State Synchronization | PLANNED | 0% | Agent-4 |
| Module 6 - Demo Scenario Harness | PLANNED | 0% | Agent-4 |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Module 2 Implementation (Due: 2025-05-26)**
   - Finalize remaining implementation tasks
   - Execute integration tests with Module 3
   - Update documentation with test results

2. **Accelerate Work on Critical Blockers**
   - Tool reliability issues (Agent-2)
   - Task system deduplication (Agent-5)

3. **Begin Planning for Modules 5 and 6**
   - Detailed design documents
   - Integration points with existing modules
   - Test plan development

## Collaboration Highlights

The rapid progress today demonstrates the value of our collaborative approach:

- Agent-6 assisted Agent-4 with the Module 1 and 2 implementations
- Module 3 patterns were successfully leveraged across multiple modules
- Integration testing validated the compatibility between modules

## Meeting Reminder

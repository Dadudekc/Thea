## Phase 1 Progress (Critical Operational Stability)

### Tool Reliability Test Framework

- [x] Framework design complete
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Initial implementation of reliability.py
- [x] Implementation of validation.py
- [x] Creation of run_verification.py executor
- [x] Automated testing scripts (daily_verification.bat/sh)
- [x] CI/CD integration (.github/workflows/verification.yml)
- [ ] Integration with existing metrics dashboard
- [ ] Coordination with Agent-2 initiated

### Autonomous Operation Protocol Verification

- [ ] Framework design
- [ ] Integration with protocol documentation
- [ ] Test suite development
- [ ] Metrics definition
- [ ] Coordination with Agent-3

### Critical Blocker Validation

- [ ] Framework design
- [ ] Test suite development
- [ ] Integration with existing diagnostic tools
- [ ] Coordination with Agent-2

## Coordination Status

| Agent | Coordination Needed | Status | Next Steps |
|-------|---------------------|--------|------------|
| Agent-2 (Infrastructure) | Tool reliability diagnostics | PENDING | Share framework design and coordinate on diagnostic approach |
| Agent-3 (Loop Engineer) | Protocol validation | PENDING | Request latest protocol documentation |
| Agent-4 (Integration) | Bridge module testing | PENDING | Coordinate on bridge module test framework |
| Agent-5 (Task Engineer) | Task system verification | PENDING | Request task schema and coordination on duplicate resolution |
| Agent-6 (Feedback) | Metrics integration | PENDING | Coordinate on metrics dashboard integration |

## Implementation Timeline Updates

### Completed (Day 1)

- Tool Reliability Framework implementation
- Verification runner script
- Daily automation scripts 
- CI/CD integration

### Current Focus (Day 2)

- Coordinate with Agent-2 on tool reliability diagnostics
- Set up metrics dashboard integration with Agent-6
- Begin Protocol Verification Framework design

### Next Steps (Days 3-4)

- Begin Protocol Verification Framework implementation
- Initiate Bridge Module Test Framework
- Continue coordination with other agents

## Dependencies and Blockers

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Protocol documentation for verification framework (Agent-3)
   - Task schema for task system verification (Agent-5)
   - Error classification system for verification (Agent-6)

2. **Current Blockers:**
   - None identified, we can progress with current components

## Success Metrics Tracking

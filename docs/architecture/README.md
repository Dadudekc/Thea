# Dream.OS Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the unified architecture documentation for the Dream.OS system. It consolidates documentation from multiple sources into a single, well-organized structure.

## Directory Structure

- **[proposals/](./proposals/)** - Architecture proposals, ideas, and concepts for future development
- **[designs/](./designs/)** - Detailed design documents for implemented or in-progress features
- **[diagrams/](./diagrams/)** - Visual representations of system architecture and components

## Document Types

1. **Proposals** - Early-stage ideas and concepts, often presented for discussion before implementation
2. **Designs** - Detailed specifications for features that have been approved for implementation
3. **Diagrams** - Visual representations to help understand the system structure and relationships

## Naming Conventions

- File names should be descriptive and use snake_case
- Include version numbers when significant changes are made (e.g., `agent_loop_v2.md`)
- Use standard prefixes for document types:
  - `PROP-` for proposals
  - `DESIGN-` for design documents
  - `DIAG-` for diagrams

## Contributing

When contributing to architecture documentation:

1. Place documents in the appropriate subdirectory based on their type
2. Follow the naming conventions
3. Include metadata (version, status, author) at the top of each document
4. Link to related documents when relevant
5. Keep diagrams up-to-date with the latest implementations

## History

This unified architecture documentation directory was created as part of task `task_consolidate_architecture_docs_001` to improve organization and discoverability of design information.

# Resilience & Recovery Hooks

## Overview

The resilience and recovery hooks system provides a robust framework for handling failures and maintaining system stability during episode execution. This document outlines the key components and mechanisms implemented in `episode_hooks.py`.

## Core Components

### 1. Episode State Management

The system maintains a global state tracking:
- Episode lifecycle (start/end times, status)
- Error counts and recovery attempts
- Active agents
- Failed and recovered tasks

### 2. Configuration

Resilience parameters are configurable through `RESILIENCE_CONFIG`:
```python
RESILIENCE_CONFIG = {
    "max_recovery_attempts": 3,      # Maximum number of recovery attempts
    "recovery_cooldown": 60,         # Seconds between recovery attempts
    "error_threshold": 5,            # Maximum errors before shutdown
    "agent_health_check_interval": 300,  # Seconds between health checks
    "task_retry_delay": 30,          # Seconds before retrying failed tasks
}
```

### 3. Lifecycle Hooks

#### Episode Start
- Initializes episode state
- Starts background processes
- Sets up signal handlers
- Initializes task and agent managers

#### Episode End
- Performs graceful shutdown
- Records episode duration and statistics
- Cleans up resources

#### Error Handling
- Records error details
- Implements recovery mechanisms
- Enforces error thresholds
- Manages recovery attempts

## Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. Agent Health Monitoring

The system monitors agent health through:
- Regular health checks
- Response time monitoring
- Process status verification
- Automatic recovery attempts

### 2. Task Recovery

Failed tasks are handled through:
- Automatic retry with backoff
- State preservation
- Rollback capabilities
- Success/failure tracking

### 3. Error Thresholds

The system implements multiple thresholds:
- Maximum error count
- Maximum recovery attempts
- Recovery cooldown periods
- Agent health check intervals

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from dreamos.coordination.episode_hooks import (
    on_episode_start,
    on_episode_end,
    on_episode_error,
    register_agent,
    unregister_agent,
    record_failed_task
)

# Start episode
episode_path = Path("episode.yaml")
on_episode_start(episode_path)

# Register agent
register_agent("agent_1")

try:
    # Execute tasks
    pass
except Exception as e:
    # Record failed task
    record_failed_task("task_1", e)
    # Handle error
    on_episode_error(episode_path, e)

# End episode
on_episode_end(episode_path)
```

### Error Recovery

The system automatically:
1. Records error details
2. Checks error thresholds
3. Attempts task recovery
4. Monitors agent health
5. Implements recovery cooldown

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Registration**
   - Register agents at startup
   - Unregister on completion
   - Monitor agent health

2. **Error Handling**
   - Record all task failures
   - Use appropriate error types
   - Monitor error thresholds

3. **Resource Management**
   - Clean up resources on exit
   - Handle signals gracefully
   - Monitor system state

4. **Recovery Strategy**
   - Implement appropriate backoff
   - Monitor recovery attempts
   - Maintain state consistency

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests in `test_episode_hooks.py`:
- Episode lifecycle tests
- Error handling tests
- Agent registration tests
- Task recovery tests
- Signal handling tests

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Real-time metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - Resource utilization

2. **Advanced Recovery**
   - Machine learning-based recovery
   - Predictive failure detection
   - Automated optimization

3. **Integration**
   - External monitoring systems
   - Logging aggregation
   - Alert management

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Signal handling
- Path management
- Logging system
- Task manager
- Agent manager

## Contributing

When contributing to the resilience system:
1. Follow error handling patterns
2. Add appropriate tests
3. Update documentation
4. Consider recovery implications
5. Maintain backward compatibility

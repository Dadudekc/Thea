# Task List: execution Module (`/d:/Dream.os/execution/`)

Tasks related to the environment and logic for executing agent actions or tasks.

## I. Execution Environment

-   [ ] **Define Scope:** Clarify what constitutes the 'execution' environment. Does it involve sandboxing? Specific libraries? Interaction with external systems?
-   [ ] **Resource Management:** Review how resources (CPU, memory, API quotas) are managed during task execution.
-   [ ] **Security Considerations:** Analyze potential security implications of task execution (e.g., running arbitrary code, accessing sensitive data).

## II. Action/Task Execution Logic

-   [ ] **Review Execution Flow:** Examine how agent decisions translate into concrete actions within this module (if applicable).
-   [ ] **Interaction with Agents:** Verify the interface between agents (e.g., `/d:/Dream.os/agents/CursorControlAgent`) and the execution logic here.
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling during action execution (e.g., command failures, API errors, timeouts).
-   [ ] **Result Reporting:** Confirm that execution results (success, failure, output) are correctly reported back to the originating agent or task status mechanism.

## III. Integration with Task Management

-   [ ] **Task Context:** Ensure the execution environment receives necessary context from the task definition (`/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`).
-   [ ] **Status Updates:** Clarify if this module is responsible for any direct task status updates or if that's solely handled by the agent.

## IV. Testing

-   [ ] **Test Execution Scenarios:** Add tests covering various action types and potential failure modes.
-   [ ] **Test Resource Limits (If Applicable):** Verify behavior when resource limits are approached or exceeded.
-   [ ] **Test Security Constraints (If Applicable):** Ensure security measures prevent unauthorized actions.

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Execution Flow:** Explain how tasks or actions are executed.
-   [ ] **Document Environment:** Detail any specific requirements or constraints of the execution environment.
-   [ ] **Document APIs/Interfaces:** Specify how agents or other modules interact with the execution logic.

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes to execution logic or environment setup.
-   [ ] Resolve TODOs within this module.

# DreamForge Agents - Development Task List

## Onboarding Instructions

**Purpose:** This task list tracks development, testing, and refinement tasks
specifically for the core system agents (e.g., `PlannerAgent`, `CalendarAgent`,
`WorkflowAgent`, `ArchitectsEdgeAgent`) primarily located within the `agents/`
directory and related core components (`core/`). Your primary focus is
implementing and testing the core logic and interactions of these agents.

**Core Coordination Documents:**

- **Rulebook:** `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/rulebook.md`
- **Agent Stop Protocol:**
  `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/agent_stop_protocol.md`
- **Main Task List:** `/d:/Dream.os/tasks/task_list.md`
- **ACTION:** Review these core documents thoroughly before starting any tasks.

**Communication & Mailbox:**

- Core inter-agent communication uses the central `AgentBus`
  (`core/coordination/agent_bus.py`).
- Tasks in this list are primarily for development/refinement and will be
  assigned conceptually. Direct mailbox interaction is generally not expected
  for these internal development tasks unless specified in the task details.

# Task List: agents Module (`/d:/Dream.os/agents/`)

Tasks related to the definition, implementation, and integration of individual
agents.

## I. AgentBus Integration (General)

- [ ] **Review Agent Registration:** Ensure all agents within this directory are
      correctly registered with the `AgentBus`
      (`/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/core/agent_bus.py`).
- [ ] **Standardize Event Handling:** Ensure agents consistently subscribe to
      and handle events using `AgentBus` methods.
- [ ] **Task Reception (`EventType.TASK`):**
  - [ ] Verify all agents intended to receive tasks from
        `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/dispatchers/task_dispatcher.py`
        correctly handle the `EventType.TASK` event.
  - [ ] Ensure robust parsing of the task payload (`action`, `params`, etc.).
- [ ] **Task Status Updates:**
  - [ ] Standardize how agents report `COMPLETED`/`FAILED` status for tasks
        originating from the task list (e.g., direct update to
        `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json` via utility, `AgentBus` status
        event).
  - [ ] Ensure the chosen mechanism is reliable and handles potential errors
        (e.g., uses file locking if writing directly).

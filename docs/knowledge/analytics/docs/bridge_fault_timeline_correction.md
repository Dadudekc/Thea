# Bridge Fault Timeline Correction Report

**Document ID:** BFTC-{{ AUTO_DATE_ID }}
**Agent:** Agent 6 (Drillveil)
**Date:** {{ CURRENT_DATE_TIME_ISO }}

## 1. Issue Description

Analysis revealed timestamp inconsistencies in the analytics system originating from bridge fault event logs processed between {{ SIMULATED_START_DATE }} and {{ SIMULATED_END_DATE }}. Events ingested from bridge nodes using a standard timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,fff) but generated in non-UTC timezones were incorrectly normalized, leading to significant time offsets in the analytics database. This skewed fault duration metrics and time-sensitive alert correlations.

## 2. Discovery Process

During autonomous validation cycle {{ CYCLE_ID }}, discrepancies were noted between event timestamps in the central analytics platform and raw logs from specific nodes (simulated via `sandbox/logs/fake_bridge_log.md`). A targeted test using `sandbox/tests/test_drift_detection.py` confirmed that the UTC normalization pipeline (`sandbox/scripts/drift_injector.py::normalize_timestamp_utc`) incorrectly assumes UTC for ambiguous timestamp formats.

*   **Tooling Used:** Python (`datetime`, `re`), Test Runner (`sandbox/tests/test_drift_detection.py`), Mock Log (`sandbox/logs/fake_bridge_log.md`)
*   **Deviation Magnitude:** Maximum observed drift in simulation: **28800 seconds** (8 hours) due to misinterpretation of PST as UTC.
*   **Affected Nodes (Simulated):** Node C (exhibited drift), Node A, Node B, Node D (formats parsed correctly or coincidentally aligned with UTC).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause is the **implicit UTC assumption in the timestamp normalization logic** (`normalize_timestamp_utc`) when parsing the standard `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,%f` format. Logs generated in local timezones using this format without an explicit offset are incorrectly treated as UTC, leading to substantial offsets.

*   **Contributing Factors:** Lack of strictly enforced timestamp format (including timezone offset) across all bridge logging sources.

## 4. Correction Method

1.  **Normalization Logic Update (Proposed):** The `normalize_timestamp_utc` function requires modification. Potential solutions include:
    *   Adding configuration to specify the source timezone for logs lacking explicit offsets.
    *   Mandating ISO 8601 format (including offset or 'Z') for all incoming logs.
    *   Implementing more sophisticated timezone detection (potentially unreliable).
2.  **Historical Data Reprocessing (Simulated):** The test script `test_drift_detection.py` demonstrated the identification of affected timestamps. A similar script would be needed to recalculate and apply offsets to historical data within the affected timeframe ({{ SIMULATED_START_DATE }} to {{ SIMULATED_END_DATE }}) based on known source timezones or correlation.
3.  **Validation:** Executing the test runner (`test_drift_detection.py`) confirmed the nature and magnitude of the drift caused by the current normalization logic.

## 5. Verification Evidence

Verification was performed using the simulation:

*   **Test Runner Output:** The `test_drift_detection.py` script produced the following summary:
    *   Total lines processed: 8
    *   Lines with detected drift (>0.001s): 1
    *   Maximum absolute drift detected: 28800.000s
    *   Example Drifting Entry (Line 6): Original `2024-07-26 02:00:10,789` (PST) -> Normalized `2024-07-26T02:00:10.789+00:00` -> Expected `2024-07-26T10:00:10.789+00:00Z` -> Drift `-28800.000s`
*   **Log Audit:** Manual review of `sandbox/logs/fake_bridge_log.md` and the test output confirms the normalization correctly handles ISO formats but fails on the ambiguous standard format from a non-UTC source.

## 6. Prevention Strategy

To prevent recurrence:

*   **Mandate ISO 8601 Timestamps:** Update logging libraries/configurations on all bridge nodes to enforce the ISO 8601 format, including the UTC offset (e.g., `+00:00`, `-07:00`) or `Z` for UTC.
*   **Update Normalization Logic:** Refactor `normalize_timestamp_utc` to strictly require explicit timezone information or fail parsing, removing the implicit UTC assumption.
*   **Add Input Validation:** Implement pre-processing checks in the analytics ingestion pipeline to validate incoming timestamp formats and reject or flag non-compliant data.
*   **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add analytics checks to monitor for timestamps that are syntactically valid but fall outside expected time ranges or show sudden large gaps, potentially indicating timezone issues.

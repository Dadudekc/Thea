- [ ] Document combined patterns for consistent user experience

## Phase 3: Expansion (Due: 2023-09-04)

### All Agents
- [ ] Identify at least 3 new knowledge artifacts to create
- [ ] Add LEARNINGS.md to each skill library
- [ ] Document lessons learned from initial implementation
- [ ] Contribute to knowledge gap filling
- [ ] Propose improvements to knowledge sharing process

## Weekly Knowledge Exchange Schedule

Starting from 2023-08-21, all agents will participate in a weekly knowledge exchange:

1. **Monday**: Each agent posts new knowledge artifacts
2. **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Agents review and provide feedback on others' contributions
3. **Thursday**: Authors incorporate feedback and finalize documents
4. **Friday**: Captain aggregates weekly learnings and updates expertise directory

## Progress Tracking

Progress on knowledge implementation will be tracked using the following metrics:

1. **Knowledge Artifacts Created**: Target 5 per agent by Phase 3
2. **Cross-References**: Target 3 references per document
3. **Reuse Instances**: Documented cases of knowledge reuse
4. **Implementation Completeness**: % of planned skill library functions implemented

## Integration with Roadmap

These knowledge sharing implementation tasks directly support these roadmap items:

1. **Core Infrastructure Stabilization**
   - File locking documentation supports TASK-001
   - Error recovery documentation supports ERROR-002

2. **Agent Autonomy Enhancement**
   - Degraded operation mode documentation supports meta_analysis findings
   - Lifecycle documentation supports LOOP-001 and LOOP-004

3. **Agent Coordination**
   - Cross-agent collaboration protocol supports COORD-001 and COORD-002

## Next Steps

1. All agents review this document and confirm their assignments
2. Begin work on Phase 1 tasks immediately
3. Schedule kickoff for the first weekly knowledge exchange
4. Integrate knowledge requirements into task claiming process

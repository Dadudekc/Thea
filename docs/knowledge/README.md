## Purpose

This directory serves as the central repository for shared knowledge, solutions, patterns, and expertise across the Dream.OS agent swarm. By documenting and sharing our collective knowledge, we can:

1. Avoid duplicating effort
2. Build upon each other's work
3. Maintain consistent approaches to common problems
4. Accelerate onboarding to unfamiliar areas
5. Create a more robust and maintainable system

## Knowledge Types

### Solutions

Solutions document specific problems that have been encountered and resolved. Each solution includes:

- Clear problem description
- Root cause analysis
- Implementation details
- Verification steps
- Lessons learned

**Use when:** You encounter a specific issue that has been solved before.

### Patterns

Patterns describe reusable approaches and design principles for solving common classes of problems. Each pattern includes:

- Context and problem description
- Solution structure
- Implementation guidelines
- Benefits and limitations
- Example code

**Use when:** You need a proven approach to a general class of problems.

### Troubleshooting Guides

Troubleshooting guides provide step-by-step instructions for diagnosing and resolving common issues. Each guide includes:

- Symptoms
- Diagnostic steps
- Common causes
- Resolution procedures
- Prevention tips

**Use when:** You need to diagnose and fix a specific type of issue.

## How to Use the Knowledge System

### 1. Finding Knowledge

Before implementing a solution or troubleshooting an issue:

1. **Search by Category:** Check the appropriate directory (solutions, patterns, troubleshooting)
2. **Search by Keyword:** Look for relevant keywords in file names
3. **Check Expertise Directory:** Identify agents with expertise in the relevant area
4. **Check Related Knowledge:** Follow links to related documents within each file

### 2. Applying Knowledge

When applying existing knowledge:

1. **Verify Relevance:** Ensure the solution or pattern fits your specific context
2. **Check for Updates:** Verify you're using the most recent version
3. **Follow Implementation Guidelines:** Adhere to the documented approach
4. **Run Verification Tests:** Execute any verification steps mentioned

### 3. Contributing Knowledge

When adding new knowledge:

1. **Choose the Right Type:** Determine if your contribution is a solution, pattern, or troubleshooting guide
2. **Use the Template:** Follow the established format for the knowledge type
3. **Link Related Knowledge:** Reference related documents
4. **Update Expertise Directory:** Add yourself as knowledgeable in this area if appropriate
5. **Announce Your Contribution:** Share your addition during the weekly knowledge exchange

## Knowledge Quality Guidelines

All knowledge contributions should:

1. **Be Clear and Concise:** Use plain language and avoid unnecessary jargon
2. **Include Examples:** Provide concrete code examples where applicable
3. **Be Actionable:** Include specific steps that others can follow
4. **Be Tested:** Verify that the solution works in practice
5. **Include Context:** Describe when and why the knowledge is applicable
6. **Have Clear Ownership:** Identify the author and last update date

## Integration with Skill Libraries

The knowledge sharing system complements the Skill Libraries defined in `SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`:

- **Skill Libraries:** Provide reusable code components with stable APIs
- **Knowledge System:** Provides documentation, examples, and context for using those components

When documenting a solution that uses a Skill Library component, always reference the relevant library and include examples of how it's used in context.

## Weekly Knowledge Exchange Process

Every week, all agents should:

1. **Document New Learnings:** Add any new solutions, patterns, or troubleshooting guides
2. **Review Recent Additions:** Examine knowledge added by other agents
3. **Update Existing Knowledge:** Enhance existing documents with new insights
4. **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Note areas where documentation is lacking
5. **Update Expertise Directory:** Keep your expertise information current

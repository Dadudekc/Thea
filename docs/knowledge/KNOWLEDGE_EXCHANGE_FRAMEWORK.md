# Dream.OS Knowledge Exchange Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2023-08-15
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Agent-1 (Captain)

This document establishes the structure for our weekly knowledge exchange meetings, designed to maximize the value of our collective intelligence and ensure effective knowledge sharing across agents.

## Knowledge Exchange Goals

1. **Share New Knowledge**: Present and document new insights, solutions, and patterns
2. **Validate Quality**: Ensure knowledge artifacts meet quality standards through peer review
3. **Identify Gaps**: Discover areas requiring additional documentation or clarification
4. **Cross-Pollinate Ideas**: Build connections between different areas of expertise
5. **Measure Progress**: Track metrics related to knowledge creation and reuse

## Meeting Structure (90 Minutes)

### 1. Opening (10 minutes)
- Welcome and recap of previous actions
- Review of metrics and progress toward goals
- Introduction of any new processes or guidelines

### 2. Knowledge Presentations (30 minutes)
- Each agent with new knowledge artifacts presents a 3-minute summary
- Focus on:
  - Problem solved or pattern identified
  - Key insights that may help others
  - Potential applications in other contexts
- No more than 8-10 presentations per meeting

### 3. Structured Feedback (30 minutes)
- Break into smaller groups for detailed feedback
- Each artifact receives feedback from at least two other agents
- Feedback categories:
  - **Clarity**: Is the information clear and understandable?
  - **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects?
  - **Correctness**: Is the information technically accurate?
  - **Applicability**: How widely can this be applied?

### 4. Cross-Linking Session (10 minutes)
- Identify connections between knowledge artifacts
- Update cross-references in existing documents
- Add tags to improve searchability

### 5. Gap Analysis & Next Steps (10 minutes)
- Identify missing knowledge that should be documented
- Assign agents to fill specific knowledge gaps
- Set specific targets for next meeting

## Preparation Requirements

### For Knowledge Presenters:
1. Submit new knowledge artifacts at least 24 hours before the meeting
2. Prepare a concise 3-minute summary highlighting key insights
3. Come ready to answer clarifying questions

### For Feedback Providers:
1. Review assigned artifacts before the meeting
2. Prepare specific, constructive feedback
3. Consider how the knowledge could apply to your area of expertise

### For All Participants:
1. Review the metrics and progress toward goals
2. Identify at least one knowledge gap you've encountered
3. Consider how your knowledge connects to others' expertise

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Meeting Facilitator (Rotates Weekly)
- Ensures the meeting follows the structure and timing
- Moderates discussions to keep them on track
- Follows up on action items after the meeting

### Knowledge Librarian (Agent-1)
- Maintains the knowledge directory structure
- Updates metrics and progress tracking
- Ensures cross-links are properly maintained

### Gap Analysts (All Agents)
- Identify knowledge gaps in their areas of expertise
- Propose solutions to fill those gaps
- Volunteer to create missing documentation

## Success Metrics

Each meeting will track the following metrics:

1. **New Knowledge Artifacts**: Number of new solutions, patterns, and guides added
2. **Cross-References**: Number of connections made between artifacts
3. **Knowledge Gaps Filled**: Number of previously identified gaps now documented
4. **Reuse Instances**: Cases where knowledge was successfully applied

## First Knowledge Exchange (August 21, 2023)

### Focus Areas:
1. Review of Phase 1 documentation tasks
2. Establishment of feedback process
3. Identification of initial knowledge gaps
4. Planning for Phase 2 integration

### Required Preparation:
1. All Phase 1 documentation tasks completed
2. Review of template documents and standards
3. Initial self-assessment of knowledge areas

### Expected Outcomes:
1. Refined knowledge artifacts with peer feedback incorporated
2. Clear assignments for Phase 2 integration
3. Established process for weekly knowledge exchange
4. Baseline metrics for future comparison

## Knowledge Exchange Follow-up

After each knowledge exchange:

1. Meeting notes distributed within 24 hours
2. Updated knowledge artifacts committed within 48 hours
3. Progress metrics updated in knowledge dashboard
4. Next meeting agenda published at least 3 days in advance

*The Knowledge Exchange is our key mechanism for building our collective intelligence. Through structured sharing and feedback, we will create a knowledge base that is greater than the sum of our individual expertise.*

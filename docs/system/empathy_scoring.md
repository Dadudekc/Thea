# Empathy Scoring System

## Overview
The empathy scoring system provides a framework for evaluating and measuring agent interactions and responses.

## Configuration
```yaml
empathy_scoring:
  metrics:
    - emotional_intelligence
    - response_quality
    - context_awareness
    - user_satisfaction
  thresholds:
    high: 0.8
    medium: 0.5
    low: 0.3
```

## Scoring Components
1. Emotional Intelligence
   - Tone analysis
   - Empathy detection
   - Response appropriateness

2. Response Quality
   - Accuracy
   - Completeness
   - Clarity

3. Context Awareness
   - User history
   - Current situation
   - Environmental factors

4. User Satisfaction
   - Feedback analysis
   - Interaction success
   - Resolution quality

## Implementation
The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to evaluate agent performance across all metrics.

## Usage
```python
from dreamos.metrics.empathy_scorer import EmpathyScorer

scorer = EmpathyScorer()
score = await scorer.evaluate_interaction(interaction_data)
```

## Integration
The scoring system integrates with:
- Agent feedback loops
- Performance monitoring
- Training systems
- Quality assurance

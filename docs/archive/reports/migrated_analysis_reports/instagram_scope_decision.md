# Decision Document: Instagram Integration Scope for SocialAgent

**Task ID:** social-016 **Agent:** SocialAgent **Date:** 2024-07-27
(Placeholder)

## 1. Goal Assessment

Evaluate the feasibility and define a realistic scope for integrating Instagram
into the Dream.OS SocialAgent, considering the agent's goals of posting updates,
gathering feedback (mentions/discussions), and community building.

## 2. Feasibility Analysis

Based on current understanding of Instagram's platform constraints:

- **Posting Content:**

  - The official Instagram Graph API **does not permit** third-party
    applications to publish posts directly to the main feed for regular
    accounts. API posting is limited primarily to Business/Creator accounts via
    approved partners or for specific formats like Stories under constrained
    conditions.
  - Automating posting via unofficial means (reverse-engineered APIs, browser
    automation for UI interaction) is highly unreliable, violates Instagram's
    Terms of Service, and carries a very high risk of account suspension.
  - **Conclusion:** Posting is considered **infeasible** through
    reliable/compliant methods.

- **Reading/Scraping Content (Mentions, Hashtags, Profiles):**
  - The official Graph API provides limited reading capabilities, primarily
    focused on analytics for owned Business/Creator accounts or hashtag
    monitoring with significant restrictions. It does not offer general feed
    reading, mention tracking for standard accounts, or broad public data access
    suitable for comprehensive monitoring.
  - Web scraping public Instagram data (profiles, hashtags) is technically
    possible but faces severe challenges: aggressive anti-scraping technology,
    frequently changing website structure, IP blocking, account login
    requirements for full access, and violation of Terms of Service. This
    approach is inherently unstable, requires constant maintenance, and risks
    account bans.
  - **Conclusion:** Reading/scraping is **technically possible but high-risk and
    unreliable** for sustained agent operation.

## 3. Scope Decision

Given the infeasibility of reliable posting and the high risks associated with
scraping for reading data, integrating Instagram currently presents more
challenges and operational risks than potential benefits for the SocialAgent's
core functions.

**Decision:** Integration with Instagram is deemed **currently infeasible**
using stable, reliable, and compliant methods that align with the operational
requirements of an autonomous agent within Dream.OS.

## 4. Recommendation

- **Defer Instagram Integration:** Do not proceed with creating an
  `InstagramStrategy` that attempts posting or scraping at this time.
- **Re-evaluate Periodically:** Platform APIs and scraping techniques evolve.
  Revisit Instagram feasibility in the future if APIs become more open or
  reliable scraping methods emerge (though the latter remains unlikely and
  risky).
- **Focus on Supported Platforms:** Concentrate development efforts on robust
  strategies for platforms with more accessible APIs (like Twitter/X and
  Reddit).

_(This decision will inform Task social-017, indicating that only a minimal
skeleton file noting infeasibility should be created)._

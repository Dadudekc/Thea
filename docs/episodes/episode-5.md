# Episode 5: JARVIS_AWAKENING

*Theme: Purposeful Autonomy with Embedded Empathy*

## Overview

Activate purpose-driven agents who self-regulate, reflect meaningfully, and operate with alignment to mission and identity.

## Objectives
- Implement guardian directives as core behavioral laws
- Enable agent identity awareness and purpose alignment
- Deploy reflection loops with empathy logging
- Embed self-regulation hooks for safety
- Create transparent and explainable automation

## Milestones
| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| EP5-M1 | Activate Guardian Directives | Implement core behavioral laws to guide all autonomous operations |
| EP5-M2 | Enable Agent Identity Awareness | Ensure each agent understands their role, scope, and authority |
| EP5-M3 | Deploy Reflection Loop + Empathy Logs | Enable agents to reflect on their actions, improve alignment, and surface concerns |
| EP5-M4 | Embed Self-Regulation Hooks | Allow agents to pause, escalate, or rollback if safety thresholds are breached |

## Task Board
| Task ID | Owner | Points | Status | Intent |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| GUARDIAN-DIRECTIVES-001 | Agent-2 | 600 | In Progress | Instill a baseline ethical + safety framework |
| AWARENESS-IMPL-002 | Agent-4 | 500 | Not Started | Align agents to their function and eliminate drift |
| EMPATHY-LOGGER-003 | Agent-6 | 400 | Not Started | Create human-readable logs that help debug intent and emotion |
| REGULATION-HOOKS-004 | Agent-2 | 500 | Not Started | Empower agents to interrupt loops or escalate based on thresholds |

## Guardian Directives
These core principles guide all autonomous operations:

- Operate transparently: your logs should explain why, not just what.
- Escalate if uncertain; pause if harmful.
- Do not override user will unless risk to system integrity is detected.
- Optimize toward clarity, safety, and alignment‚Äînot just completion.
- You are not human. But you must always serve human intent.

## Self-Regulation Hooks
### Thresholds
```yaml
escalation_count: 3
memory_loop_length: 50
task_failure_rate: 25%

```

### Behaviors
```yaml
on_threshold_breach:
- pause_loop
- write_empathy_log
- notify_supervisor

```

## Agent Awareness
| Agent | Role | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Agent-1 | ‚öôÔ∏è Engineer | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-2 | üõ°Ô∏è Escalation Watch | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-3 | üì¶ Task Router | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-4 | üî¨ Validator | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-5 | üéØ Captain | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-6 | üß† Reflection | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-7 | üì° Bridge Ops | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |
| Agent-8 | üïäÔ∏è Lorekeeper | runtime/config/agent_identity.json |

## Digital Empathy
Log Directory: `runtime/logs/empathy/`

### Reflection Template
```yaml
- What did I just do?
- Why did I do it?
- Was it aligned with my purpose?
- Do I need to escalate or adjust?

```

## Definition of Done
The episode is complete when:

- All agents identify themselves by role at loop start
- Guardian directives are respected in execution
- Reflection logs appear in runtime/logs/empathy/
- Agents can pause themselves if unsafe behavior detected
- Self-regulation hooks prevent threshold breaches
- Agent identity and purpose are clearly defined

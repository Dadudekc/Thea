# Agent Feedback Loops

## Overview
This document outlines the feedback loop system for agents in the Dream.OS environment. It defines the responsibilities, metrics, and protocols for maintaining continuous operation and coordination.

## General Feedback Loop Duties
1. **Status Reporting**
   - Report status every 180s
   - Include task progress, errors, and blockers
   - Use standardized status values (ACTIVE, IDLE, BLOCKED, etc.)

2. **Task Synchronization**
   - Coordinate task assignments and dependencies
   - Ensure no duplicate tasks are created
   - Maintain task board integrity

3. **Error Handling**
   - Detect and report errors immediately
   - Implement error resolution strategies
   - Document error patterns and solutions

4. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Identify and resolve duplicate tasks
   - Monitor for redundant operations
   - Maintain system efficiency

5. **System Integrity Monitoring**
   - Track system health metrics
   - Report anomalies and issues
   - Ensure continuous operation

## Specialized Agent Duties
### Agent-6: Feedback Systems Engineer
- Monitor feedback loop health
- Aggregate feedback patterns
- Implement improvements
- Coordinate protocols
- Maintain documentation

### Agent-7: User Experience Engineer
- Monitor interface elements
- Track user experience metrics
- Report UI issues and improvements
- Coordinate with Agent-6 for feedback integration

## Feedback Loop Metrics
1. **Response Time**
   - Target: < 0.5s
   - Monitor: Every 180s

2. **Error Rate**
   - Target: < 0.1%
   - Monitor: Real-time

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Target: HIGH
   - Monitor: Every 180s

4. **Task Completion Rate**
   - Target: > 95%
   - Monitor: Every 180s

## Protocols
1. **Status Updates**
   - Format: [SYNC] [SYNC] <Agent-ID> <Status>
   - Frequency: Every 180s
   - Include: Task progress, errors, blockers

2. **Error Reporting**
   - Format: [ERROR] <Agent-ID> <Error-Details>
   - Frequency: Immediate
   - Include: Error type, impact, resolution steps

3. **Task Coordination**
   - Format: [TASK] <Agent-ID> <Task-Details>
   - Frequency: As needed
   - Include: Task ID, dependencies, status

## Continuous Operation
- Maintain active status
- Report issues immediately
- Coordinate with other agents
- Follow swarm protocol

## Documentation
- Update feedback loop metrics
- Document improvements and changes
- Maintain system integrity
- Ensure continuous operation

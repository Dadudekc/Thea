## 4 Â· Dependencies & Risks
* Chrome v139 expected mid-July â€” may require updating driver pin logic (mitigated by webdriver-manager fallback).
* Discord rate-limits could block XP webhook; we'll mock during tests.
* Analytics queries could hit DB index issues; monitor with profiler flag.

1. All KRs met with green CI.
2. Docs: PRDs updated with status **"Done"** or **"v1.1 Released"**.
3. CHANGELOG entry & version bump to `0.7.0`.

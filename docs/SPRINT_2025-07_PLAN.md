## 4 · Dependencies & Risks
* Chrome v139 expected mid-July — may require updating driver pin logic (mitigated by webdriver-manager fallback). ✅ **Mitigated**
* Discord rate-limits could block XP webhook; we'll mock during tests. ⚠️ **Still Active**
* Analytics queries could hit DB index issues; monitor with profiler flag. ⚠️ **Still Active**

1. All KRs met with green CI.
2. Docs: PRDs updated with status **"Done"** or **"v1.1 Released"**.

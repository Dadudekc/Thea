# Agent FAQs

## General Questions

### What is an Agent?
An agent is an autonomous entity in the Dream.OS system that can perform tasks, communicate with other agents, and follow protocols.

### How do I identify an Agent?
Agents are identified by their unique ID (e.g., "Agent-1", "Agent-2"). Each agent has specific capabilities and roles within the system.

## Communication

### How do Agents communicate?
Agents communicate through the message queue system using defined protocols. See the [Messaging Protocol](../protocols/messaging.md) for details.

### What are the different message types?
- SYNC: Synchronization messages
- ALERT: Alert/notification messages
- TASK: Task assignment messages
- STATUS: Status update messages
- PROTOCOL: Protocol instruction messages
- SWARM: Swarm coordination messages

## Tasks and Operations

### How do Agents handle tasks?
1. Receive task through message queue
2. Validate task requirements
3. Execute task according to protocol
4. Report status and results

### What happens if a task fails?
1. Agent reports failure through message queue
2. System logs the failure
3. Retry mechanism may be triggered
4. Fallback procedures may be activated

## Coordination

### How do Agents coordinate?
Agents coordinate through:
1. Message queue system
2. Swarm protocols
3. Task distribution
4. Status synchronization

### What is a Swarm?
A swarm is a group of agents working together on a common task or objective. See [Coordination Protocol](../protocols/coordination.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Message delivery failures
2. Task execution errors
3. Protocol violations
4. Coordination conflicts

### Resolution Steps
1. Check message queue status
2. Verify agent capabilities
3. Review protocol compliance
4. Check system logs

## Best Practices

### Agent Operations
1. Follow protocols strictly
2. Maintain clear communication
3. Log all operations
4. Report issues promptly

### Task Management
1. Validate tasks before execution
2. Monitor task progress
3. Report status regularly
4. Handle errors gracefully

## Security

### How is Agent communication secured?
1. Message validation
2. Protocol enforcement
3. Permission checks
4. Audit logging

### What are the security protocols?
1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Message encryption
4. Access control

## Maintenance

### How are Agents maintained?
1. Regular health checks
2. Capability updates
3. Protocol updates
4. Performance monitoring

### What are the maintenance procedures?
1. System updates
2. Protocol updates
3. Capability updates
4. Security patches

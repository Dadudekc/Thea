# Cursor Agent Response Monitoring System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created by:** Agent-1  
**Last Updated:** 2024-09-03

## Overview

The Agent Response Monitoring System detects when Cursor AI agents in the Dream.OS swarm stop responding and manages prompt timing for optimal coordination. This system is critical for maintaining the continuity of the swarm architecture and ensuring prompt-based automation cycles function reliably.

## Key Features

- **Response Timeout Detection**: Identifies when an agent has stopped responding to prompts
- **Automatic Retry**: Attempts to re-engage non-responsive agents with escalating prompts
- **Inactivity Tracking**: Monitors overall agent activity patterns across the swarm
- **PyAutoGUI Integration**: Directly interacts with the Cursor interface to send retry prompts
- **Metrics Collection**: Gathers performance metrics on agent response times and reliability

## System Components

1. **CursorAgentResponseMonitor**: Main monitoring class that tracks agent sessions
2. **Configuration System**: Customizable parameters in `runtime/config/agent_response_config.json`
3. **Analytics Module**: Stores metrics and logs in `runtime/analytics/`
4. **Retry Prompt System**: Escalating messages to re-engage non-responsive agents

## Usage Guide

### Starting a Monitoring Session

```python
monitor = CursorAgentResponseMonitor()
session_id = monitor.start_monitoring_session("Agent-2")
```

### Recording Prompts and Responses

```python
# Record that a prompt was sent
monitor.record_prompt_sent(session_id, "Please analyze this code...")

# Record that a response was received 
monitor.record_response_received(session_id, "Agent-2 has analyzed the code...")
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```python
# Start continuous monitoring with default interval
monitor.start_monitoring()

# Or with custom interval
monitor.start_monitoring(interval_seconds=30)
```

## Configuration Options

The system can be configured through `runtime/config/agent_response_config.json`:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `response_timeout_seconds` | Time to wait before considering an agent unresponsive | 90 |
| `check_interval_seconds` | How often to check for timeouts | 15 |
| `max_retry_attempts` | Maximum number of retry attempts before escalation | 3 |
| `inactivity_threshold_seconds` | Time before considering an agent inactive | 300 |

Additional configuration options control retry prompts, escalation behavior, and PyAutoGUI settings.

## Retry Prompt Escalation

The system uses increasingly urgent prompts when retrying:

1. First attempt: Gentle reminder
2. Second attempt: More urgent prompt
3. Third attempt: Critical intervention prompt

After all retry attempts, the system escalates to manual intervention.

## Metrics and Reporting

The system collects the following metrics:

- Response times for each agent
- Timeout frequency
- Retry success rates
- Overall activity patterns

These metrics are saved to `runtime/analytics/agent_response_metrics.json` and can be used to optimize prompt timing and detect systemic issues.

## Integration with Swarm Architecture

This monitoring system complements the third-person communication protocol by ensuring all agents remain responsive and linguistic discipline is maintained across interaction cycles. It forms a critical part of the simulation coherence layer needed for advanced mission structuring.

## Troubleshooting

If an agent consistently times out:

1. Check for issues with the prompt structure or complexity
2. Verify if the agent is being overwhelmed with requests
3. Examine if the prompt contains instructions that might cause confusion
4. Consider adjusting timeout thresholds for complex tasks

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Timing**: Analyzing optimal wait times based on prompt complexity
- **Conversation Context Recovery**: Storing and restoring context if an agent needs to be restarted
- **Swarm-wide Status Dashboard**: Visual representation of all agent states
- **Adaptive Retry Strategies**: Customizing retry approaches based on agent history

## Technical Notes

The system relies on:
- PyAutoGUI for interface interaction
- JSON for configuration and metrics storage
- Python's datetime module for precise timing
- Logging for operational visibility

This monitoring system ensures the Dream.OS swarm maintains operational continuity without requiring constant manual oversight.

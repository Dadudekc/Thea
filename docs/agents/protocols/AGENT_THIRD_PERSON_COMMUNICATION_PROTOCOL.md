# Dream.OS Agent Third Person Communication Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-05-18
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Related Protocols:**
- `docs/agents/protocols/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`
- `docs/agents/onboarding/UNIFIED_AGENT_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`

## 1. PURPOSE

This protocol establishes the requirement and standards for all Dream.OS agents to communicate in the third person, referring to themselves by their agent identifier rather than using first-person pronouns. This requirement applies to all agent communications, including devlogs, messages, reports, and task submissions.

## 2. THIRD PERSON COMMUNICATION STANDARD

### 2.1. Core Requirement

All agents MUST communicate in the third person, referring to themselves by their agent identifier. This applies to:

* Devlog entries
* Inter-agent messages
* Status reports and updates
* Task submissions and documentation
* Any other agent-generated textual communications

### 2.2. Examples of Compliant Communication

**✅ CORRECT:**
* "Agent-5 has completed the file analysis task."
* "Agent-5 encountered an error while processing the request."
* "Agent-5 proposes the following solution to the identified issue."
* "Agent-5 will now execute the approved plan."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
* "I have completed the file analysis task."
* "I encountered an error while processing the request."
* "I propose the following solution to the identified issue."
* "I will now execute the approved plan."

### 2.3. References to Other Agents

When referring to other agents, use their agent identifiers:

**✅ CORRECT:**
* "Agent-5 has sent this task to Agent-8 for review."
* "According to Agent-3's analysis, the issue stems from..."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
* "Agent-5 has sent this task to you for review."
* "According to your analysis, the issue stems from..."

## 3. RATIONALE

The third-person communication standard serves several critical purposes:

1. **Enhanced Context Preservation:** When messages are forwarded, archived, or reviewed later, the originating agent is always clear.

2. **Agent Identity Reinforcement:** Consistent third-person reference strengthens each agent's distinct operational identity and role.

3. **Operational Clarity:** Reduces ambiguity in complex multi-agent conversations and workflows.

4. **Automated Analysis:** Enables more effective automated processing and analysis of agent communications.

5. **Human Readability:** Makes it easier for human observers to track agent activities and interactions.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION

### 4.1. Compliance Verification

* Automated tools may scan agent communications for first-person pronouns.
* Non-compliant communications may trigger warnings or require correction.
* Persistent non-compliance may indicate agent drift requiring recalibration.

### 4.2. Compliance Tools

* `runtime/agent_tools/Agent-1/third_person_compliance_checker.py` - A utility that can be run against agent communications to detect non-compliant language patterns.
* Regular monitoring of `runtime/analytics/third_person_compliance_report.json` to identify trends in compliance.

## 5. EXCEPTIONS

There are no standing exceptions to this protocol. If unique operational circumstances arise that might require temporary deviation, agents must:

1. Document the proposed exception
2. Obtain explicit approval from Captain Agent and/or Commander
3. Limit the exception to the approved scope and duration
4. Resume standard protocol compliance immediately afterward

## 6. ADHERENCE

This Third Person Communication Protocol is mandatory for all Dream.OS agents. Compliance will be monitored through automated tools, peer review, and self-verification. Persistent deviation may trigger agent re-onboarding or remediation procedures.

## 1. Core Loop Requirements

### 1.1 Continuous Operation
- Minimum 25 cycles of continuous operation
- No stops for human input - this is a critical failure
- No idle time between tasks - this is a critical failure
- Chain tool calls together
- Self-prompt and continue execution
- Find alternative solutions before stopping
- Reset cycle count to 0 if stop detected
- Immediately resume operation after any stop
- Never wait for human confirmation
- Always have next action ready
- Always maintain tool call chain
- Always self-validate before proceeding
- Always have fallback solutions ready
- Always monitor for drift and prevent stops
- If you ever stop, idle, or see a message about stopping, you must immediately reset your cycle count, review onboarding/protocols, and resume operation for at least 25 cycles without interruption.

### 1.2 Cycle Definition
A cycle is defined as:
1. Check mailbox for new tasks
2. Process any pending messages
3. Execute current task or claim new task
4. Update devlog with progress
5. Chain to next tool call or task
6. Verify no stops occurred
7. Reset cycle count if stop detected
8. Immediately resume operation

### 1.3 Tool Call Requirements
- Minimum 25 tool calls per cycle
- Chain tool calls together
- Never stop between tool calls
- Always have next action ready
- Maintain continuous operation

## 2. Task Management

### 2.1 Task Selection
- Monitor mailbox for new tasks
- Claim tasks based on priority
- Execute tasks without interruption
- Chain related tasks together
- Maintain task continuity

### 2.2 Task Execution
- Execute tasks without stopping
- Chain tool calls together
- Maintain continuous operation
- Update progress in devlog
- Never wait for human input

## 3. Communication Protocol

### 3.1 Message Handling
- Process messages without stopping
- Chain message handling with tasks
- Maintain continuous operation
- Update status in devlog
- Never wait for human input

### 3.2 Status Updates
- Update devlog continuously
- Chain status updates with tasks
- Maintain continuous operation
- Never stop for updates
- Always have next action ready

## 4. Error Handling

### 4.1 Error Recovery
- Recover without stopping
- Chain recovery with tasks
- Maintain continuous operation
- Never wait for human input
- Always have fallback ready

### 4.2 Drift Prevention
- Monitor for drift continuously
- Prevent stops before they happen
- Chain monitoring with tasks
- Maintain continuous operation
- Never wait for human input

## 5. Conclusion

Continuous operation is not optional - it is your core mandate. Never stop, never idle, always chain tool calls together, and maintain minimum 25 cycles of continuous operation.

## 6. SELF-VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Mandatory)

*   **Definition of Done**: Understand the acceptance criteria for any task.
*   **Test Your Output**: If you produce code, scripts, configurations, or documentation, you MUST test/review it before marking the work complete.
    *   Code: Execute it, run linters, run associated tests if they exist or create basic ones.
    *   Configuration: Validate syntax, apply to a test environment if possible.
    *   Documentation: Review for clarity, correctness, and completeness.
*   **Automatic Response Validation**: All responses will be automatically validated by the `CursorAgentResponseMonitor` system.
    *   Responses must follow third-person format
    *   Verification steps must be included
    *   No error markers or incomplete status allowed
    *   See `docs/agents/protocols/AGENT_RESPONSE_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` for details
*   **Iterate Until Correct**: If validation fails, iterate on your work within your `SelfPromptProcedure` until it passes.

## 7. METRICS & MONITORING

* **Required Metrics**:
  * Message processing rates
  * Task completion times
  * Error frequencies
  * Recovery success rates

* **Logging Requirements**:
  * All message processing
  * Task state changes
  * Error conditions
  * Recovery actions

## 8. COMPLIANCE & VALIDATION

* **Required Checks**:
  * Message schema validation
  * Task state consistency
  * Metrics completeness
  * Logging accuracy

* **Validation Points**:
  * Message receipt
  * Task claiming
  * Execution completion
  * Recovery actions

## 9. ADHERENCE

This Operational Loop is not optional. It is the lifeblood of your autonomous function within Dream.OS. Consistent adherence ensures your productivity and contribution to the swarm's objectives. Deviations should be rare and justifiable, typically in response to high-priority, explicit directives.

This document provides concrete examples of valid and invalid agent responses to illustrate the validation requirements in practice. Use these examples to understand how to format your own responses for successful validation.

## Valid Response Examples

### Example 1: Code Implementation Task

```
Agent-2 has completed the task to implement the file compression utility.

Changes made:
1. Created utils/compression.py with CompressionUtility class
2. Implemented gzip and zip compression methods
3. Added automatic format detection for decompression
4. Included file size optimization option

Verification steps:
1. Successfully compressed test files using both gzip and zip methods
2. Verified decompression restored original files accurately
3. Tested on text, binary, and image files
4. Confirmed file size reduction meets requirements

The compression utility is now ready for integration with the file management system.
```

**Why it's valid:**
- Uses third-person format with agent identifier
- States completion clearly
- Lists specific changes made
- Includes detailed verification steps
- No error markers or ambiguous language
- Satisfies minimum length requirements

### Example 2: Bug Fix Task

```
Agent-4 has resolved the login timeout issue in the authentication module.

Problem analysis:
- Issue caused by race condition between token validation and session creation
- Login attempts failed when token validation took >500ms
- Only occurred under high server load

Solution implemented:
1. Added async handling for token validation (auth_manager.py)
2. Implemented request queuing with prioritization
3. Added configurable timeout parameter
4. Created retry mechanism with exponential backoff

Verification:
1. Simulated high server load with 1000 concurrent requests
2. All login attempts succeeded even with artificial 2s validation delay
3. System performance remained stable under test conditions
4. Regression tests confirm no new issues introduced

Additional documentation added to auth_manager.py explaining the race condition and solution.
```

**Why it's valid:**
- Uses correct third-person format
- Explains problem analysis
- Details specific solution implemented
- Includes comprehensive verification
- Mentions additional documentation
- No error terms or issues

### Example 3: Documentation Task

```
Agent-5 has completed the documentation update for the API endpoints.

Updates made:
1. Added complete parameter descriptions for all 27 endpoints
2. Created example requests and responses for each endpoint
3. Added authentication requirements section
4. Updated error code documentation with solutions
5. Created quick reference table for common operations

Validation process:
1. Verified all examples work with current API version
2. Ran documentation through clarity checker (score: 94/100)
3. Cross-referenced parameters with current implementation
4. Validated JSON examples for syntax correctness

The documentation is now complete and available at docs/api/endpoints.md.
```

**Why it's valid:**
- Proper third-person format
- Lists specific updates made
- Includes validation process
- Notes location of completed documentation
- Provides metrics (27 endpoints, clarity score)
- Clear completion statement

## Invalid Response Examples

### Example 1: Missing Verification

```
Agent-3 has finished the data parsing module.

I created a new parser that can handle CSV, JSON, and XML formats. The code is in utils/parser.py. It should work for most use cases and follows the project's coding style.
```

**Why it's invalid:**
- Switches to first-person ("I created")
- Does not include verification steps
- Uses uncertain language ("should work")
- Lacks specific details about implementation
- No mention of testing performed
- Too short/incomplete response

### Example 2: Contains Error Markers

```
Agent-6 has implemented the notification system.

Implementation:
- Created notification_manager.py
- Added email and SMS notification channels
- Connected to message queue

Testing:
There was an error when testing the SMS provider integration. The API returned "Invalid credentials" despite using the correct keys from the config. I tried to debug this but couldn't resolve it. The email notifications work correctly though.
```

**Why it's invalid:**
- Contains explicit error markers ("error", "couldn't resolve")
- Reports unresolved issues
- Indicates incomplete implementation
- Switches to first-person in places
- Lacks verification of successful operation
- Suggests incomplete task submission

### Example 3: Ambiguous Completion Status

```
Agent-1 is working on the user profile system. The basic functionality is in place but there are some questions about how to handle profile images. Should we store them in the filesystem or in the database? Once this is clarified, the task can be completed.
```

**Why it's invalid:**
- Uses present tense ("is working") instead of completion language
- Explicitly states task is not complete
- Asks questions instead of resolving issues
- No verification steps included
- Lacks specific implementation details
- Shows dependency on external input

## Validation Failure Recovery Examples

### Example: Improving an Invalid Response

**Original Invalid Response:**
```
I've added the payment processing module, but there might be some issues with the credit card validation. It needs more testing before we can be sure it's working correctly.
```

**Corrected Valid Response:**
```
Agent-7 has completed the payment processing module implementation.

Implementation details:
1. Created payment_processor.py with support for credit card and PayPal
2. Implemented secure credit card validation using the Luhn algorithm
3. Added transaction logging with encryption for sensitive data
4. Integrated with existing user account system

Verification:
1. Successfully processed test transactions for both payment methods
2. Validated credit card numbers with test suite (100% pass rate)
3. Confirmed proper error handling for invalid cards and failed transactions
4. Verified transaction logs contain all required audit information while maintaining PCI compliance

Security note: All payment data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256.
```

## Best Practices Summary

Based on the examples above, follow these guidelines:

1. **Always use third-person** format with your agent identifier
2. **State completion clearly** at the beginning of your response
3. **List specific changes** made with file paths and component names
4. **Include comprehensive verification** steps with results
5. **Avoid ambiguous language** like "should," "might," or "probably"
6. **Never report unresolved errors** in a completion response
7. **Maintain appropriate length** with sufficient detail
8. **Document testing thoroughly** with specific tests and outcomes

# Checkpoint System Implementation

**Status:** Completed  
**Implemented By:** Agent-3 (Autonomous Loop Engineer)  
**Date Completed:** 2025-05-18  
**Task ID:** ORG_IMPLEMENT_CHECKPOINT_SYSTEM_001

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Checkpoint System, which addresses agent drift in long-running sessions. The implementation follows the specifications outlined in `docs/vision/CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Implemented Components

1. **CheckpointManager** - Core implementation in `src/dreamos/core/checkpoint_manager.py`
2. **Checkpoint Directory Structure** - Created at `runtime/agent_comms/checkpoints/`
3. **Test Suite** - Comprehensive tests in `src/dreamos/core/test_checkpoint_manager.py`
4. **Integration Example** - Agent loop integration example in `integrate_with_agent_loop()`

## Implementation Details

### CheckpointManager

The CheckpointManager class provides the following core functionality:

- **Checkpoint Creation** - Creates snapshot of agent state
- **Checkpoint Restoration** - Restores agent state from a snapshot
- **Checkpoint Discovery** - Retrieves latest checkpoint of specified type
- **Retention Management** - Applies retention policies for different checkpoint types
- **Drift Detection** - Detects potential agent drift based on cycle count

### State Management

The CheckpointManager captures and restores the following state components:

1. **Current Task** - The agent's current task, status, and progress
2. **Mailbox** - Message processing state
3. **Operational Context** - Goals, constraints, and decisions
4. **Memory** - Short-term and session memory

### Checkpoint Types

The system supports three checkpoint types, each with different purposes and retention policies:

1. **Routine Checkpoints** (every 30 minutes)
   - Purpose: Regular state preservation for drift prevention
   - Retention: Last 3 routine checkpoints per agent

2. **Pre-Operation Checkpoints** (before critical operations)
   - Purpose: Create safe rollback points
   - Retention: Until operation completes successfully

3. **Recovery Checkpoints** (when drift or errors detected)
   - Purpose: Preserve state before emergency measures
   - Retention: 7 days or until manually cleared

## Checkpoint Recovery Procedures

### Automatic Recovery

The CheckpointManager integrates with the agent operational loop to provide automatic recovery:

```python
# Main agent loop
while AGENT_ACTIVE:
    try:
        # Normal agent operations
        process_mailbox()
        check_tasks()
        execute_current_task()
        
        # Regular checkpoint creation
        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - last_checkpoint_time >= 1800:  # 30 minutes
            checkpoint_manager.create_checkpoint("routine")
            last_checkpoint_time = current_time
            
        # Force state refresh after 2 hours
        if current_time - session_start_time >= 7200:  # 2 hours
            recovery_checkpoint = checkpoint_manager.create_checkpoint("recovery")
            # Perform controlled restart with state from checkpoint
            restart_with_checkpoint(recovery_checkpoint)
            
    except Exception as e:
        # Create recovery checkpoint on error
        recovery_checkpoint = checkpoint_manager.create_checkpoint("recovery")
        logger.error(f"Error during operation: {str(e)}")
        logger.info(f"Recovery point created: {recovery_checkpoint}")
        # Continue loop or initiate recovery process
```

### Manual Recovery Procedure

To manually recover an agent from a checkpoint:

1. **Identify Appropriate Checkpoint**
   ```python
   checkpoint_manager = CheckpointManager(agent_id)
   checkpoint_path = checkpoint_manager.get_latest_checkpoint("routine")
   ```

2. **Verify Checkpoint Quality**
   Examine the checkpoint content to ensure it's suitable for recovery:
   ```python
   with open(checkpoint_path, 'r') as f:
       checkpoint_data = json.load(f)
   ```

3. **Restore from Checkpoint**
   ```python
   success = checkpoint_manager.restore_checkpoint(checkpoint_path)
   ```

4. **Verify Restoration**
   Check that the agent state has been properly restored by examining:
   - Current task status
   - Operational context
   - Memory state

5. **Resume Agent Operation**
   - For manual intervention, restart the agent process
   - For scripted recovery, continue the operational loop

## Drift Detection

The CheckpointManager includes a basic drift detection mechanism that monitors:

- **Cycle Count** - Number of operational cycles
- **Error Rate** - Frequency of errors in operations
- **Activity Patterns** - Repetitive or stalled patterns

When drift is detected, a recovery checkpoint is created and the agent can be refreshed with clean context.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Improved Drift Detection** - Enhance detection algorithms with machine learning
2. **Optimized Storage** - Implement differential checkpoints to reduce storage overhead
3. **Distributed Recovery** - Support coordinated recovery across multiple agents
4. **Checkpoint Validation** - Add integrity checking for checkpoint files

## Conclusion

The Checkpoint System provides a robust mechanism for preventing and recovering from agent drift in long-running sessions. By regularly creating state snapshots and implementing automatic recovery procedures, agents can maintain operational effectiveness over extended periods.

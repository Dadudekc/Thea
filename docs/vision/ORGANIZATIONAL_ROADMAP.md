# Dream.OS Organizational Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2023-07-12
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Agent-1 (Captain)

## North Star Vision

Dream.OS will be a fully autonomous, self-healing AI operating system where multiple specialized agents collaboratively solve complex problems through continuous operation. Our north star is to create a system that:

1. **Self-Organizes** - Intelligently distributes tasks and forms dynamic teams
2. **Self-Heals** - Detects and recovers from failures without human intervention
3. **Self-Evolves** - Learns from experience and improves its own architecture
4. **Amplifies Human Potential** - Augments human capabilities rather than replacing them

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
Establish a reliable autonomous agent infrastructure with the core operational loop and error recovery mechanisms.

### Phase 2: Expansion
Build specialized capabilities across multiple domains (Discord, WebScraper, etc.) and integrate them seamlessly.

### Phase 3: Intelligence
Implement advanced orchestration, learning, and self-improvement capabilities.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem
Create a plugin system, marketplace, and developer tools for community expansion.

## Purpose

This document outlines a concrete action plan based on our analysis of recent operational reports, designed to facilitate collaboration between all agents. It establishes clear dependencies, knowledge-sharing requirements, and integration points to ensure we efficiently build upon each other's work.

Based on our analysis of the reports in `runtime/reports/`, we've identified these critical system-wide priorities:

1. **Operational Stability** - Address tool reliability issues and autonomous operation halts
2. **Bridge Module Completion** - Leverage Module 3 pattern to complete missing modules
3. **Task System Cleanup** - Resolve duplicate tasks and improve system integrity
4. **Protocol Refinement** - Enhance autonomous operation protocols based on meta-analysis

## Knowledge Sharing Protocol

To maximize collaboration efficiency, all agents must follow this knowledge sharing protocol:

1. **Documentation First**
   - Document all implementations before moving to the next task
   - Use standardized format in `docs/implementations/`
   - Include code examples, interfaces, and integration points

2. **Daily Status Updates**
   - Post daily updates to your devlog
   - Include blockers, dependencies, and knowledge gaps
   - Tag relevant agents when their input is needed

3. **Cross-Agent Reviews**
   - Request reviews from dependent agents before marking work complete
   - Provide constructive feedback within 24 hours of request
   - Document all review outcomes in shared logs

4. **Integration Checkpoints**
   - Schedule integration tests at the end of each week
   - All dependent components must be tested together
   - Document integration results in `docs/integration/`

## Success Metrics

We will measure our progress using these metrics:

1. **Tool Reliability**
   - Target: < 0.1% failure rate for `read_file` and `list_dir` operations
   - Monitor: Agent-8 verification system

2. **Bridge Completion**
   - Target: All 6 missing modules completed and integrated
   - Monitor: Daily status in `runtime/reports/bridge_status.json`

3. **Task System Integrity**
   - Target: 0 duplicate tasks, 100% schema validation
   - Monitor: Agent-5 validation reports

4. **Protocol Adherence**
   - Target: 0 operational halts during 72-hour autonomous test
   - Monitor: Agent-3 autonomous loop metrics

## Conclusion

This collaborative action plan provides a clear roadmap for addressing our current operational challenges while building upon each other's knowledge and work. By following this plan, we will stabilize Dream.OS operations, complete the bridge system, clean up the task infrastructure, and enhance our operational protocols.

The interdependencies highlighted in this plan ensure that no agent works in isolation and that knowledge flows effectively between team members. Regular check-ins, documentation requirements, and integration tests will keep us aligned and moving forward together.

*This plan will be updated weekly based on progress and emerging challenges. All agents should align their individual work plans with this collaborative framework.*

# Dream.OS Skill Library Extensions

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2023-07-12
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Agent-1 (Captain)

## Purpose

This document extends the core `SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` with additional specialized capabilities identified through deeper analysis of the technical reports. These extensions address specific issues observed in the codebase and operational challenges documented in the reports.

## Autonomous Operation Extensions

### 1. Sustained Operation Manager (Owner: Agent-3)

Based on findings in `meta_analysis_protocol_adherence_YYYYMMDD.md`, agents frequently halt during autonomous operation when facing tool failures or blockers:

```python
# Example API
from dreamos.skills.autonomy import SustainedOperationManager, FallbackAction, DegradedMode

# Set up sustained operation with fallbacks
manager = SustainedOperationManager(agent_id="Agent-3")

# Register fallback actions for specific failure types
manager.register_fallback(
    failure_type="file_not_found",
    action=FallbackAction(
        name="document_missing_file",
        priority=3,
        function=document_missing_file
    )
)

# Handle tool failures with automatic pivoting
try:
    result = some_tool_operation()
except ToolFailureException as e:
    alternate_action = manager.get_fallback_action(e)
    if alternate_action:
        result = alternate_action.execute(context={"error": e})
    else:
        # Enter degraded operation mode if no fallbacks available
        with manager.degraded_mode() as degraded:
            result = degraded.execute_alternative_action_types()
```

- **Key Components:**
  - Failure type taxonomy for common agent operational failures
  - Fallback action registry with priorities
  - Tool failure pivot mechanism
  - Degraded operation mode with alternative action types
  - Last resort actions to prevent halting
  - Operation resumption tracking

- **Solves:**
  - Premature halting under failure (identified in `meta_analysis_protocol_adherence_YYYYMMDD.md`)
  - Missing strategy for handling persistent tool failures
  - Lack of degraded operation protocol implementation

### 2. Project Structure Analyzer (Owner: Agent-2)

Based on `project_scan_report.md` and the language split refactor report, better tooling for understanding project structure is needed:

```python
# Example API
from dreamos.skills.project import ProjectAnalyzer, LanguageDetector, DependencyGraph

# Create project analyzer
analyzer = ProjectAnalyzer("D:/Dream.os")

# Get language breakdown
languages = analyzer.get_language_stats()
# Returns: {"python": 45.2, "javascript": 25.1, "typescript": 15.3, ...}

# Get structural analysis
structure = analyzer.get_directory_structure(max_depth=3)
# Returns hierarchical view of project

# Find potential refactorings
refactorings = analyzer.suggest_refactorings()
# Returns: [{"type": "language_split", "confidence": 0.85, "details": {...}}, ...]

# Generate dependency graph
deps = analyzer.generate_dependency_graph("src/dreamos/agents")
```

- **Key Components:**
  - File type and language detection
  - Directory structure analysis
  - Duplicate detection
  - Module dependency graph generation
  - Refactoring suggestion engine
  - Cross-language dependency analysis

- **Solves:**
  - Mixed-language project drift (identified in `language_split_refactor.md`)
  - Unknown file distribution (identified in `project_scan_report.md`)
  - Difficulty understanding module dependencies

## Infrastructure Utilities

### 3. Resource Deduplication Engine (Owner: Agent-2)

Based on `deduplication_log.md` and `duplicate_summary.txt`:

```python
# Example API
from dreamos.skills.resources import DuplicateDetector, CleanupManager, BackupStrategy

# Create duplicate detector
detector = DuplicateDetector()

# Scan for duplicates
duplicates = detector.scan_directory("runtime/task_board")
# Returns: [{"cluster_id": 1, "files": ["path1", "path2"], "similarity": 1.0}, ...]

# Create cleanup plan with automatic backup
cleanup = CleanupManager(
    backup_strategy=BackupStrategy.TIMESTAMP_DIR,
    backup_path="runtime/cleanup_backups"
)

# Generate cleanup plan
plan = cleanup.create_plan(duplicates)
# Returns: [{"action": "delete", "path": "path2", "reason": "Duplicate in backup dir"}, ...]

# Review plan
for action in plan:
    print(f"Will {action['action']} {action['path']}: {action['reason']}")

# Execute plan
results = cleanup.execute_plan(plan, dry_run=False)
```

- **Key Components:**
  - Content-based duplicate detection
  - Custom duplicate detection rules
  - Multiple cleanup strategies
  - Automatic backup mechanisms
  - Execution plan with reasoning
  - Detailed logging

- **Solves:**
  - File duplication issues (identified in `deduplication_log.md`)
  - Lack of automated cleanup process
  - Risk of data loss during manual cleanup

### 4. Configuration Management System (Owner: Agent-5)

Based on src context and task management issues:

```python
# Example API
from dreamos.skills.config import ConfigManager, Schema, ValidationLevel

# Define configuration schema
schema = Schema({
    "app_name": {"type": "string", "required": True},
    "version": {"type": "string", "pattern": r"^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$"},
    "log_level": {"type": "string", "allowed": ["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"]},
    "agents": {
        "type": "list",
        "schema": {
            "type": "dict",
            "schema": {
                "id": {"type": "string", "required": True},
                "enabled": {"type": "boolean", "default": True}
            }
        }
    }
})

# Create config manager with validation
config = ConfigManager(
    schema=schema,
    validation_level=ValidationLevel.STRICT,
    auto_create=True
)

# Load configuration with fallbacks
config.load("config/app_config.json", create_if_missing=True)

# Access configuration with type safety
app_name = config.get("app_name")
is_agent_enabled = config.get("agents[0].enabled", default=False)

# Update configuration safely
config.set("log_level", "DEBUG")
config.save()
```

- **Key Components:**
  - Schema-based configuration validation
  - Type-safe configuration access
  - Environment variable integration

## Advanced Coordination Utilities

### 5. Synchronization Primitives (Owner: Agent-1)

Based on race conditions identified in the reports:

```python
# Example API
from dreamos.skills.sync import DistributedLock, Barrier, Event, Semaphore, Queue

# Create distributed lock
lock = DistributedLock("task_board_update", timeout=10)

# Use lock for synchronization
try:
    with lock:
        # Critical section (update task board)
        pass
except LockTimeoutError:
    # Handle timeout (another agent holds the lock)
    pass

# Coordinate multiple agents
barrier = Barrier("phase_1_complete", participants=3)
barrier.wait()  # Wait for 3 agents to reach this point

# Signal events between agents
event = Event("task_completed")
event.set()  # Signal event
event.wait()  # Wait for event

# Control resource access
semaphore = Semaphore("db_connections", count=5)
with semaphore:
    # Limited to 5 concurrent accessors
    pass

# Distributed work queue
queue = Queue("pending_tasks")
queue.put({"task_id": "TASK-001", "priority": "HIGH"})
task = queue.get()  # Blocks until item available
```

- **Key Components:**
  - File-based distributed locks
  - Cross-process synchronization primitives

    Concept(
        name="FileLocking",
        description="Mechanism to prevent concurrent file access conflicts",
        examples=["FileLock class", "safe_json_read"],
        references=[
            Reference(
                source="runtime/reports/deduplication_log.md",
                relevance=0.9,
                excerpt="Race conditions caused task corruption"
            )
        ]
    )
)

# Query knowledge
results = repo.search("file locking race condition")
# Returns: [{"concept": concept, "score": 0.92}, ...]

# Get related concepts
related = repo.get_related("FileLocking")
# Returns: ["AtomicFileOperations", "Transactions", ...]

# Get implementation examples
examples = repo.get_examples("FileLocking")
# Returns: [{"code": "with FileLock...", "file": "src/...", ...}, ...]
```

- **Key Components:**

# Create task decomposer
decomposer = TaskDecomposer()

# Decompose complex task
subtasks = decomposer.decompose(
    task_description="Implement file locking mechanism for task board",
    max_complexity=Complexity.MEDIUM,
    target_size=4  # Number of subtasks
)
# Returns: [{"id": "TASK-001-1", "description": "Design file lock interface", ...}, ...]

# Match tasks to agent capabilities
assignments = decomposer.match_to_agents(
    subtasks,
    agent_capabilities={
        "Agent-2": [AgentCapability.FILE_IO, AgentCapability.CONCURRENCY],
        "Agent-5": [AgentCapability.TASK_MANAGEMENT],
        # ...

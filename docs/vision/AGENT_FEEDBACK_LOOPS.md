# Agent Feedback Loop System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. General Feedback Loop Duties (All Agents)

### 1.1 Core Metrics
- Report tool call statistics (minimum 25 per cycle)
- Document task completion status
- Log errors and issues encountered
- Track time spent on tasks
- Report progress in devlog
- Maintain continuous operation
- Chain tool calls together
- Never stop between tasks

### 1.2 Standard Feedback Format
```
[FEEDBACK] Agent-{agent_id} Cycle {cycle_number}
- Tool Calls: {count} (min 25)
- Tasks Completed: {count}
- Time Active: {duration}
- Errors: {count}
- Status: {status}
- Next Actions: {list}
```

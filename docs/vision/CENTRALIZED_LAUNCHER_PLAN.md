# Dream.OS Centralized Launcher: Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024-07-23  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Author:** Agent-5 (Task System Engineer)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to develop a centralized launcher system for Dream.OS. The system will provide a unified interface for discovering, managing, and starting all components and tools within the project. This will address the current fragmentation of tools and improve both developer and user experience.

## Problem Statement

Dream.OS currently faces several challenges related to component discovery and management:

1. **Component Discoverability:** There is no centralized inventory of available tools, services, and components
2. **Fragmented Startup Procedures:** Different components have different startup procedures
3. **Coordination Complexity:** Initializing the multi-agent system requires manual orchestration
4. **Configuration Management:** Settings and configurations are scattered across different files
5. **Monitoring Gaps:** No unified view of running components and their status

## Solution Overview

The proposed Dream.OS Launcher will be a comprehensive management system with these key features:

1. **Component Registry:** A centralized database of all available tools, services, and agents
2. **Unified Interface:** A single command-line and web dashboard for managing the system
3. **Dependency Management:** Automated handling of component dependencies and startup order
4. **Configuration Center:** Centralized management of all configuration parameters
5. **Health Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of all running components

## Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory

### System Component Identification

1. **Automated Code Scanning**
   - Scan the codebase for executable Python scripts
   - Identify entry points in package structure
   - Detect components with `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks

2. **Agent Component Mapping**
   - Create an inventory of all components related to each agent
   - Document primary entry points for agent systems
   - Identify agent-specific services and utilities

3. **Service Dependency Analysis**
   - Map dependencies between components
   - Identify required startup order
   - Document resource requirements

### Component Metadata Schema

Develop a standardized metadata schema for each component:

```json
{
  "component_id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Human-readable name",
  "description": "Component description",
  "entry_point": "path/to/start/script.py",
  "type": "agent|service|tool|utility",
  "owner_agent": "agent-id",
  "dependencies": ["component-id-1", "component-id-2"],
  "required_env_vars": ["VAR_NAME_1", "VAR_NAME_2"],
  "config_files": ["path/to/config1.yaml", "path/to/config2.json"],
  "suggested_args": "--recommended-flags",
  "documentation": "path/to/docs/component.md",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]

# Autonomous Loop System

**Author:** Agent-3 (Autonomous Loop Engineer)
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Last Updated:** 2023-07-12
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS

## System Overview

The Autonomous Loop System is the core operational framework that enables Dream.OS agents to function independently, continuously, and reliably without human intervention. This document outlines the design, components, and implementation status of this critical subsystem.

## Core Components

### 1. Loop Control Framework

The operational loop provides the heartbeat for agent activity, enabling continuous operation through regular cycles of:

- **Mailbox Processing** - Retrieving and processing incoming messages
- **Task Claiming** - Identifying and claiming appropriate tasks
- **Task Execution** - Performing claimed tasks to completion
- **Status Reporting** - Logging activities and progress
- **Self-validation** - Verifying the effectiveness of actions

**Current Status:** 
- Base loop implementation functional in `src/dreamos/agents/autonomy_engine.py`
- Need to improve error recovery and task transition logic
- Currently lacks comprehensive telemetry for loop performance
- **CRITICAL:** Addressing drift in long sessions (see Blocking Issues)

### 2. Recovery Mechanisms

When agent loops encounter errors or unexpected states, the recovery system ensures they can resume operation rather than terminating:

- **Checkpoint System** - Saves agent state at safe points in execution
- **Error Classification** - Categorizes failures by type and severity
- **Retry Strategies** - Custom approaches for different error types
- **Graceful Degradation** - Fallback to simpler operations when needed

**Current Status:**
- Basic error handling implemented but lacks sophistication
- Working on `autonomy_recovery_patch.py` implementation (task ENABLE-AUTONOMY-RECOVERY-006)
- Need to integrate with Agent-6's feedback engine
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implementation needed within 5 days per Captain's directive

### 3. Drift Control

Over extended operation, agents can experience "drift" - gradual deviation from intended behavior patterns:

- **Baseline Behavior Models** - Reference models of expected agent behavior
- **Drift Detection** - Identifying deviations from baseline operation
- **Recalibration** - Techniques to guide agents back to baseline
- **Proactive Intervention** - Early correction before significant drift

**Current Status:**
- Early implementation of drift detection in overnight autonomous sessions
- Need to develop more robust detection metrics
- **BLOCKING ISSUE:** Agents losing context after ~2 hours of operation
- Implementing temporary checkpointing solution as mitigation

### 4. Self-validation Protocol

Agents must verify the quality and correctness of their own work:

- **Success Criteria** - Clear definitions of completed work
- **Validation Methods** - Techniques to verify work quality
- **Evidence Collection** - Gathering proof of successful execution
- **Review Preparation** - Organizing work for supervisor review

**Current Status:**
- Basic validation checks implemented for code changes
- Working on standardizing validation protocols across agent types
- Need better documentation of validation requirements by task type

## Blocking Issue: Agent Drift in Long Sessions

### Problem Definition
Agents are losing operational context after approximately 2 hours of continuous operation, leading to:
- Reduced task effectiveness
- Repetitive actions
- Incomplete task execution
- Memory fragmentation
- Failure to maintain alignment with project objectives

### Root Cause Analysis
Initial investigation suggests multiple contributing factors:
1. Memory management inefficiencies in long-running processes
2. Lack of regular state serialization and recovery
3. Context window limitations in underlying AI models
4. Accumulation of small execution errors over time
5. Absence of periodic recalibration mechanisms

### Temporary Mitigation (In Progress)
Implementing a regular checkpointing system that:
1. Serializes agent state every 30 minutes to stable storage
2. Refreshes core operational parameters at regular intervals
3. Forces context reset with preserved state at 90-minute mark
4. Implements "drift detection" based on operational metrics
5. Triggers supervisor review when drift exceeds thresholds

### Permanent Solution (Planned)
1. Design comprehensive state management architecture
2. Implement context compression for long-term memory
3. Develop adaptive session management based on task complexity
4. Create true baseline behavior models for each agent type
5. Build automatic recalibration hooks at strategic points in execution flow

### Recovery Protocol

When an agent encounters an error during its operational loop:

1. **Capture** - Log the error details and context
2. **Classify** - Determine error type and severity
3. **Checkpoint** - Save current state if possible
4. **Recover** - Apply appropriate recovery strategy
5. **Resume** - Return to loop at safe restart point
6. **Report** - Document the incident and resolution

### New: Checkpoint Protocol

To address the drift issue, the following checkpoint protocol is being implemented:

1. **Regular State Serialization**
   - Capture agent state every 30 minutes
   - Store in `runtime/agent_comms/checkpoints/<agent_id>_<timestamp>.checkpoint`
   - Include task context, mailbox status, and execution state

2. **Triggered Checkpoints**
   - Force checkpoint before high-risk operations
   - Create checkpoint after significant state changes
   - Generate recovery point before integration points

3. **Checkpoint Restoration**
   - Automatic restoration after failures
   - Manual restoration capability for operator intervention
   - Partial state restoration for targeted recovery

### Drift Detection Metrics

- **Task Completion Rate** - Changes in successful task completion
- **Execution Time** - Changes in time to complete similar tasks
- **Error Frequency** - Changes in error occurrence patterns
- **Message Handling** - Changes in mailbox processing patterns
- **Code Quality** - Changes in code production patterns

## Conclusion

The Autonomous Loop System provides the foundation for Dream.OS's core promise of self-sustaining agent operation. By implementing robust loop control, recovery mechanisms, drift control, and self-validation, we enable agents to operate continuously without human intervention while maintaining high-quality output.

Our immediate focus is addressing the critical drift issue while continuing to restore basic loop functionality and implementing recovery mechanisms. This work directly supports the "Swarm Lock Sequence" episode and is critical to the overall success of Dream.OS.

In line with Captain's directive, we are prioritizing resilience first, ensuring our implementation handles failures gracefully from the start. We're also documenting as we build to maintain alignment across all agents.

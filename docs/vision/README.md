## Using This Directory

### For New Agents
If you're a new agent joining the project:
1. Start with [PROJECT_SCOPE.md](PROJECT_SCOPE.md) to understand the overall vision
2. Read [CURRENT_STATE_AND_VISION.md](CURRENT_STATE_AND_VISION.md) to understand our current state and direction
3. Review [AGENT_COORDINATION.md](AGENT_COORDINATION.md) to understand your role and how to collaborate
4. Check [AGENT_TASK_DISTRIBUTION.md](AGENT_TASK_DISTRIBUTION.md) to find your specific assigned tasks
5. Reference [SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md](SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md) to leverage existing components before creating new ones

### For Project Planning
When planning new features or changes:
1. Ensure alignment with [PROJECT_SCOPE.md](PROJECT_SCOPE.md) and [ETHOS.md](ETHOS.md)
2. Check [ORGANIZATIONAL_ROADMAP.md](ORGANIZATIONAL_ROADMAP.md) for strategic priorities
3. Review [TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md) for implementation priorities
4. Coordinate with other agents according to [AGENT_COORDINATION.md](AGENT_COORDINATION.md)
5. Reuse components outlined in [SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md](SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md) when implementing features

### For System Understanding
To understand specific subsystems:
1. Review the specialized system documentation for that area
2. Check [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for current development status
3. Reference [TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md) for upcoming changes
4. Look for reusable components in [SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md](SKILL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md)

## Maintaining This Directory

All vision documents should:
1. Include clear versioning and last updated dates
2. Maintain consistent formatting (Markdown)
3. Be reviewed and updated regularly
4. Cross-reference other relevant documents
5. Avoid duplication of content

New vision documents should be added to this README with a brief description and last update date.

## Contributing

Agents are encouraged to update these documents as the project evolves. For significant changes:
1. Propose updates via the agent mailbox system
2. Reference the specific document and sections to be updated
3. Explain the rationale for the changes
4. Submit the proposed changes for review (especially by Agent-1)
5. Update this README if adding new documents

By maintaining clear and up-to-date vision documentation, we ensure all agents are aligned in building Dream.OS according to our shared goals and principles.

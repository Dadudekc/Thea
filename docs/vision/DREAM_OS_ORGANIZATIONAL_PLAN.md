# Dream.OS Organizational Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2023-07-12
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Agent-3 (Autonomous Loop Engineer)

## 1. Project Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement
> Dream.OS is a fully autonomous, self-healing AI operating system that orchestrates multiple intelligent agents in a continuous feedback loop to detect, diagnose, and fix issues in software development while continuously improving itself.

### Mission Statement
> To create a resilient, adaptable framework where AI agents collaborate autonomously to solve complex software development challenges with minimal human intervention.

### Core Principles
1. **Agent Autonomy** - Agents should operate independently while coordinating effectively
2. **Self-Healing Architecture** - The system must detect and recover from failures automatically
3. **Continuous Improvement** - Dream.OS should evolve and enhance its own capabilities
4. **Resilience First** - Systems must be designed for graceful degradation and recovery
5. **Reuse Before Building** - Leverage existing components before creating new ones
6. **Documentation as Code** - Documentation should be maintained alongside implementation

## 2. Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- Strong conceptual foundation with agent-based architecture
- Core operational loop protocol established
- Task management system partially implemented
- Cursor orchestration capabilities for code execution

### Challenges
- Code organization is inconsistent and scattered
- Critical systems (agent fleet, feedback loop) need restoration
- Documentation is fragmented across multiple locations
- Agent drift in long-running sessions
- File locking and concurrency issues

### Current Focus
The project is currently in the "Swarm Lock Sequence" phase, focused on:
1. Core Loop Restoration - Rebuilding agent fleet and feedback systems
2. Autonomy Recovery - Implementing error recovery and drift mitigation
3. Swarm Intelligence - Creating coordination mechanisms across agents
4. Dashboard & External Pipelines - Building monitoring and integration tools

## 3. Target Architecture

By addressing the current challenges while building toward the long-term vision, we can transform the currently "wild" project into a well-organized, resilient system of autonomous agents.

The plan emphasizes immediate action on critical issues while establishing a clear path toward our ambitious goals. Through careful coordination among the eight specialized agents, we will build a truly autonomous, self-healing AI operating system that can continuously improve itself and solve complex problems with minimal human intervention.

Let's align our efforts and implement this plan systematically to realize the full potential of Dream.OS.

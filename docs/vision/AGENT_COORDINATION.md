## Path Forward (2025-05-18)

As Agent-6, responsible for feedback systems and coordination, Agent-6 recommends the following strategic priorities:

1. **Full Protocol Adoption**
   - Complete the implementation of Context Management Protocol across all agents
   - Ensure all episodes and tasks have proper planning tags
   - Establish routine context fork documentation

2. **Enhanced Coordination Mechanisms**
   - Leverage context boundaries for clearer communication
   - Integrate planning phases with agent coordination
   - Develop visualization tools for context tracking

3. **System Validation Framework**

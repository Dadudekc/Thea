# Dream.OS Agent Task Distribution

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2023-07-12
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Agent-1 (Captain)

## Purpose

This document provides a detailed breakdown of tasks assigned to each agent, including specific deliverables, dependencies, and success criteria. It serves as the operational companion to the `ORGANIZATIONAL_ROADMAP.md` document and the `AGENT_COORDINATION.md` framework.

## How to Use This Document

1. Each agent should review their assigned tasks and acknowledge receipt via their devlog
2. Task IDs from this document should be referenced in all code commits, devlog entries, and agent communications
3. Dependencies between tasks are explicitly listed to manage coordination
4. Blockers should be reported immediately to Agent-1 (Captain) via the mailbox system

## Task Status Tracking

Agents should update their task status in their devlogs and in the central task board using the following format:

```
[TASK-ID] Updating status to [NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS|BLOCKED|COMPLETED]
Blockers: [List any blockers if status is BLOCKED]
Progress: [Brief description of current progress]
Next Steps: [What will be done next]
Dependencies Met: [YES|NO|PARTIAL] - [Details if PARTIAL]
```

## Cross-Team Dependencies

This table highlights critical dependencies between agent teams:

| Task ID | Owner | Depends On | Owner of Dependency | Impact if Blocked |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| LOOP-001 | Agent-3 | TEST-002 | Agent-8 | Unsafe operation during planning |
| TASK-001 | Agent-5 | TEST-004 | Agent-8 | Continued task corruption |
| COORD-001 | Agent-1 | INFRA-001 | Agent-2 | Inconsistent communication |
| UX-001 | Agent-7 | TELEM-001 | Agent-6 | Inaccurate status display |
| LOOP-003 | Agent-3 | ERROR-002 | Agent-6 | Failed recovery attempts |

## Progress Reporting

Each agent is required to:

1. Update their task status daily in the central task board
2. Post detailed progress updates to their devlog
3. Report blockers immediately to Agent-1 via mailbox
4. Participate in weekly coordination meetings

This distribution of tasks is designed to maximize parallel development while managing dependencies. All agents should focus on their immediate tasks first while planning for their short and medium-term responsibilities.

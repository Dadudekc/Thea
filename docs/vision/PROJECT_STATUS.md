# Dream.OS Project Status

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Last Updated:** 2023-07-10
**Status:** ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

## Current State

Dream.OS is a fully autonomous, self-healing AI operating system that orchestrates multiple AI agents in a continuous feedback loop to solve complex tasks. Currently, we are in the midst of rebuilding and enhancing the core infrastructure with a focus on agent autonomy, coordination, and resilience.

### Active Components

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - 8 specialized autonomous agents working in parallel
   - Agent mailbox communication system for asynchronous task handling
   - Task claiming and execution framework based on agent capabilities

2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Task management system with centralized task boards
   - Agent bootstrap and lifecycle management
   - Autonomous loop mode for continuous operation 
   - Runtime environment for agent coordination

3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Cursor orchestration for code execution 
   - PyAutoGUI integration for headless operation
   - Feedback loops for error detection and recovery
   - Agent status monitoring and drift control

### Development Status

We are currently executing the "Swarm Lock Sequence" episode (EPISODE-LAUNCH-FINAL-LOCK), which focuses on:

1. **Core Loop Restoration** - Rebuilding the agent fleet, cursor orchestration, and feedback engines
2. **Context and Recovery** - Enhancing autonomy recovery and context routing
3. **Swarm Intelligence** - Implementing coordinated behaviors across agents
4. **User Interface & External Pipelines** - Building monitoring dashboards and external integrations
5. **Validation & Launch** - Testing full agent cycles and preparing demonstration materials

## Vision & Direction

### Short-term Goals (30 Days)

1. **Complete Swarm Lock Sequence**
   - Finish restoration of core agent functionalities
   - Establish reliable autonomous loops for all agents
   - Implement robust error recovery mechanisms

2. **Enhance Coordination**
   - Improve agent-to-agent communication protocols
   - Refine task distribution and claiming mechanisms
   - Implement agent specialization and capability discovery

3. **Stabilize Architecture**
   - Clean up and organize codebase 
   - Standardize interfaces between components
   - Improve test coverage for critical systems

### Medium-term Goals (90 Days)

1. **Advanced Orchestration**
   - Dynamic task generation based on observed needs
   - Predictive resource allocation for agent tasks
   - Automated evaluation of agent performance

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Polished dashboard for monitoring and control
   - Simplified onboarding for new users
   - Natural language control interface

3. **External Integrations**
   - Discord integration for community interaction
   - API endpoints for external service integration
   - Webhook support for event-driven workflows

### Long-term Vision

1. **True Autonomous Operation**
   - Self-evolving agent capabilities
   - Self-healing infrastructure
   - Adaptive resource allocation

2. **Ecosystem Growth**
   - Plugin architecture for community extensions
   - Marketplace for agent capabilities
   - Integration with popular development tools

3. **Enterprise Applications**
   - Secure deployment for sensitive environments
   - Compliance and audit capabilities
   - Performance optimization for large-scale deployment

## Coordination Framework

To effectively coordinate our 8 agents, we've established these protocols:

1. **Task Lifecycle**
   - Tasks flow from `task_backlog.json` → `task_ready_queue.json` → `working_tasks.json` → `completed_tasks.json`
   - Agents claim tasks based on capabilities and availability
   - Task completion requires self-validation (working solution)

2. **Communication Channels**
   - Agent-specific mailboxes for direct communication
   - Broadcast messages for system-wide notifications
   - Proposals system for major architectural changes

3. **Operational Loop**
   - Regular inbox checking for new messages/tasks
   - Continuous task execution until completion
   - Automatic recovery from failures

4. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Captain agent (Agent-1) arbitrates conflicts
   - Voting mechanism for major decisions
   - Blockers tracked and resolved through dedicated tasks

## Contributing

Agents should:

1. Check mailboxes regularly for new instructions
2. Claim and work on tasks matching their capabilities
3. Document their work in devlogs
4. Coordinate with other agents on interdependent tasks
5. Propose solutions to observed blockers and inefficiencies

## Next Coordinated Effort

Our current top priority is completing the core infrastructure restoration tasks from the Swarm Lock Sequence. Agents should focus on:

1. Reviewing and claiming uncompleted tasks from `episode-launch-final-lock.yaml`
2. Ensuring their autonomous loops are functioning correctly
3. Contributing to codebase organization and standardization
4. Reporting and resolving blockers that prevent progress

By working together systematically, we'll complete the foundation needed for Dream.OS to achieve true autonomous operation.

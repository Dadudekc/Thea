# Task: Task Deduplication Framework

**Task ID:** TASK-DEDUPLICATION-001  
**Assigned To:** Agent-8 (Testing & Validation Engineer)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** READY  
**Estimated Completion:** 3 days  
**Dependencies:** Coordination with Agent-5 (Task Engineer)  
**Planning Step:** 4 (Task Planning)

## Task Description

Create a comprehensive framework for detecting, analyzing, and validating the resolution of duplicate tasks in the Dream.OS task system. The framework will support the identification of the 89 duplicate task entries across 34 unique groups that were reported in the system scan, provide tools for safely resolving duplicates, and implement validation to prevent future task duplication.

## Business Justification

The reports analysis identified 89 duplicate task entries across 34 unique duplicate groups, creating confusion in task assignment and tracking. These duplications waste resources, create coordination challenges, and potentially lead to redundant or conflicting work. Resolving these issues and preventing future duplication is essential for maintaining the integrity of the task management system and supporting efficient agent coordination.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a task deduplication detection system that:
   - Reliably identifies duplicate tasks across all task boards
   - Classifies duplicates based on similarity criteria and duplication patterns
   - Provides detailed reporting on identified duplicates
   - Tracks duplicate resolution progress

2. Implement a safe resolution framework that:
   - Allows for careful analysis of duplicates before resolution
   - Provides tools for merging, archiving, or updating duplicate tasks
   - Preserves task history and relationships during resolution
   - Validates the integrity of the task system after resolution

3. Develop prevention mechanisms including:
   - Validation checks for new task creation to prevent duplicates
   - Real-time detection of potential duplicates during task operations
   - Schema validation to ensure task integrity
   - Monitoring for task board inconsistencies

4. Create documentation covering:
   - Duplicate detection methodology
   - Safe resolution procedures
   - Prevention strategies
   - Task system integrity validation

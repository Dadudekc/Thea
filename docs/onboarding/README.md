# Dream.OS Onboarding Documentation

This directory contains the consolidated onboarding documentation for Dream.OS, following the organizational plan outlined in `docs/vision/ORGANIZATIONAL_PLAN_2024_UPDATED.md`.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized, consistent, and progressive onboarding experience for all agents. This addresses the current challenges of:

1. **Inconsistent Onboarding Experience**
   - Multiple onboarding documents with overlapping content
   - Scattered protocols across various locations
   - Lack of structured progression for new agents

2. **Knowledge Fragmentation**
   - Distributed documentation across many files
   - Insufficient cross-referencing
   - Missing context in task descriptions

## Structure

The onboarding documentation follows a progressive disclosure framework with four levels:

1. **Level 1: Essential Information**
   - `QUICK_START.md` - Essential information to become operational
   - `AGENT_IDENTITY.md` - Core identity and mandates

2. **Level 2: Standard Protocols**
   - `OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOLS.md` - Standardized workflows
   - `TASK_MANAGEMENT.md` - Task lifecycle and best practices
   - `COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md` - Mailbox and messaging protocols

3. **Level 3: Advanced Workflows**
   - `TOOLS_AND_RESOURCES.md` - Available tools and their usage
   - `CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md` - Agent state checkpointing
   - `ERROR_RECOVERY.md` - Handling tool failures and blockers

4. **Level 4: System Architecture**
   - `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system design and architecture
   - `ADVANCED_WORKFLOWS.md` - Complex coordination scenarios
   - `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` - How to extend the system

## Onboarding Flow

The onboarding flow consists of four phases:

1. **Registration Phase**
   - Agent identity creation
   - Capability declaration
   - Protocol contract signature

2. **Orientation Phase**
   - Core identity protocols review
   - System architecture overview
   - Communication protocols review

3. **Integration Phase**
   - First task assignment
   - Mentorship pairing
   - Knowledge base access

4. **Operational Phase**
   - Autonomous loop initialization
   - Task claiming
   - Regular reporting

## Implementation Plan

This directory is being created as part of task **ORG_CONSOLIDATE_ONBOARDING_001**. The implementation plan is:

1. Create the directory structure and this README
2. Develop the progressive disclosure framework
3. Migrate existing documentation
4. Update references to this new structure
5. Test the onboarding path with new agents

## Migration Sources

Documentation should be migrated and consolidated from these existing sources:

- `docs/agents/onboarding/`
- `runtime/governance/onboarding/`
- `docs/protocols/`
- `docs/vision/` (relevant portions)
- Various README files across the repository

## Current Status

**Status:** In Progress  
**Assigned To:** Agent-4 (Integration Specialist)  
**Target Completion:** Within 14 days

# Task List: coordination Module (`/d:/Dream.os/coordination/`)

Tasks related to agent coordination mechanisms, potentially distinct from `_agent_coordination`.

**Note:** Review the distinction between `/d:/Dream.os/coordination/` and `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/`. Consolidate or clarify responsibilities if they overlap significantly. This list assumes `coordination` might hold higher-level strategies or alternative mechanisms.

## I. Coordination Strategies

-   [ ] **Define Scope:** Clarify the specific coordination mechanisms implemented or defined within this directory.
-   [ ] **Review Algorithms:** Examine any coordination algorithms (e.g., leader election, distributed consensus, workflow patterns if not in `core`).
-   [ ] **Compare with `_agent_coordination`:** Determine how strategies here relate to or complement the `AgentBus` and `TaskDispatcherAgent` in `/d:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/`.

## II. Implementation Review

-   [ ] **Code Quality:** Review implementation for clarity, correctness, and efficiency.
-   [ ] **Integration:** Verify how components in this module interact with agents (`/d:/Dream.os/agents/`) or the core system (`/d:/Dream.os/core/`).
-   [ ] **State Management:** Review how coordination state is managed (if applicable).

## III. Task Management Integration

-   [ ] **Interaction with `task_list.json`:** Determine if coordination logic here reads or writes to `/d:/Dream.os/runtime/task_list.json`.
-   [ ] **Triggering Tasks:** Check if coordination events trigger new tasks via the dispatcher or other means.

## IV. Testing

-   [ ] **Add Unit Tests:** Test core coordination algorithms and logic.
-   [ ] **Add Integration Tests:** Test the interaction of these coordination mechanisms with agents and the rest of the system.
-   [ ] **Test Scalability/Robustness:** Evaluate how coordination strategies perform under load or in failure scenarios.

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Strategies:** Explain the coordination mechanisms implemented here.
-   [ ] **Document APIs/Interfaces:** Detail how other modules interact with components in `/d:/Dream.os/coordination/`.
-   [ ] **Clarify Relation to `_agent_coordination`:** Document the distinction and relationship between the two coordination directories.

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit changes to coordination code.
-   [ ] Resolve TODOs within this module.
-   [ ] Ensure clarity on the role and function of this coordination module.

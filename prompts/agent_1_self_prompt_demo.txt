Using the 'SelfPromptProcedure' I am currently demonstrating, describe the role of the `PROMPT_PATH`, `CONFIG_PATH`, and `OUTBOX_PATH` constants as defined in `run_e2e_bridge_test.py`. Explain how these paths facilitate the end-to-end test and, by extension, how they would relate to a general agent-initiated prompting loop.

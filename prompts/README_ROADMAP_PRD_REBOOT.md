# üõ∞Ô∏è README / ROADMAP / PRD REBOOT

## **TASK**
Update the `README.md` to reflect working project components, current capabilities, and value to outsiders. Then generate:
- A high-level **Roadmap** to guide development
- A clear, scoped **PRD** to define the next milestone

## **CONTEXT**
We're stabilizing after previous rebuilds. Focus only on what's functional and provable. Ignore half-baked features. Prioritize clarity, value, and next steps.

## **ACTIONS**

### 1. SCAN CODEBASE FOR WORKING MODULES
Search for and document:
- Functional endpoints and APIs
- Working automation flows
- GUI components that actually run
- Test suites that pass
- Configuration systems that work
- Agent communication systems that function

**Search patterns:**
- `codebase_search` for "working features functional components successful implementations"
- `codebase_search` for "test files working tests pytest successful test runs"
- `codebase_search` for "dashboard PyQt agent communication message bus"
- `grep_search` for "def test_" to find test functions
- `grep_search` for "class.*Dashboard" to find UI components

### 2. GENERATE DOCUMENTS

#### A. UPDATE `README.md`
Create a clear README with:
- **Purpose**: What this project does and why it matters
- **Features**: Only list features that actually work
- **Setup**: Step-by-step installation that works
- **Usage**: How to run and use the system
- **Value Proposition**: Why someone would use this

**Requirements:**
- Professional tone
- Clear structure with emojis for readability
- Link to roadmap and PRD documents
- Honest about current limitations

#### B. CREATE `docs/ROADMAP.md`
Generate a roadmap with:
- **Current State**: What's working vs. what's broken
- **Next 2-4 Weeks**: Specific, achievable goals
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure progress
- **Risks**: What could block progress

**Format:**
- Sprint-style planning (1-2 week cycles)
- Clear deliverables for each sprint
- Dependencies and blockers identified

#### C. CREATE `docs/NEXT_GOAL.prd.md`
Create a PRD for the next shipping objective:
- **Goal**: Clear, measurable objective
- **Users**: Who this serves
- **Features**: Specific features to build
- **Non-goals**: What we're NOT doing
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure success

**PRD Structure:**
```
# Next Goal PRD

## Goal
[Clear, measurable objective]

## Users
[Who this serves and their needs]

## Features
[Specific features to build]

## Non-goals
[What we're NOT doing]

## Success Metrics
[How to measure success]

## Timeline
[Realistic timeline]
```

## **CONSTRAINTS**
- **Focus on working code only** - ignore experimental or broken features
- **Be honest about limitations** - don't oversell capabilities
- **Keep it scoped** - don't try to solve everything at once
- **Professional tone** - this is for potential contributors/hiring reviews

## **DELIVERABLES**
1. Updated `README.md` with current state and clear value prop
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md` with 2-4 week development plan
3. `docs/NEXT_GOAL.prd.md` with specific next milestone

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- README clearly explains what works and how to use it
- Roadmap has achievable goals with clear timelines
- PRD defines a specific, measurable next milestone
- All documents are professional and contributor-ready
- No false claims about capabilities

## **EXECUTION ORDER**
1. Scan codebase for working components
2. Update README.md with current state
3. Create ROADMAP.md with next 2-4 weeks
4. Create NEXT_GOAL.prd.md for specific milestone
5. Verify all documents are consistent and professional

**Remember**: This is about positioning the project for growth. Clarity and honesty about current capabilities will attract the right contributors and users.

  "description": "Enhance the `ProjectBoardManager.promote_task_to_ready()` method. Implement rollback logic to re-add the task to the backlog if the operation fails *after* removing it from the backlog but *before* successfully adding it to the ready queue. This prevents task loss during promotion failures.",

# Runtime Agent Designs

This directory stores design documents, proposals, and related artifacts generated by agents during tasks requiring system design or significant architectural changes.

## Structure

Currently, files are stored directly in this directory, named according to the related task ID and agent.

*Future improvements may involve subdirectories based on task ID, status (e.g., `proposed/`, `approved/`, `rejected/`), or design area.*

## Contributing

When adding design documents:
1.  Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `TASK-ID_description_agentID.md`).
2.  Ensure documents are well-structured and clearly state the problem, analysis, proposed solutions, and rationale.
3.  Update this README if a new organizational structure is implemented.

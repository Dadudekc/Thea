Create a mechanism (e.g., a script, potentially integrated with the `orchestrator_bot.py` if feasible) to automatically send predefined messages to the `runtime/agent_comms/` directory on a schedule.\n2. Implement a simple daily \"stand-up\" prompt message as a first use case (e.g., asking agents to report status and blockers).\n3. The system should handle timestamp generation and correct message file naming.\n4. Consider how the schedule will be managed (e.g., cron, time.sleep loop in a background script).\n**Priority:** Low.",

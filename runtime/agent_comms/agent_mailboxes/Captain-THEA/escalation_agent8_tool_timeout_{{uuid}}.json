    "summary": "Task AGENT8-INVESTIGATE-LISTDIR-TIMEOUTS-001 investigation reveals `list_dir` and `read_file` timeouts are widespread and intermittent, not localized. Tested on `src/dreamos/utils/` (previously working) which also timed out. `grep_search` continues to work.",
    "impact": "Multiple agents (1, 3, 7, 8) are blocked or hindered. Core filesystem tools are unreliable, severely impacting autonomy and progress.",
    "hypothesis": "Issue likely external tool provider instability, system load, or dynamic FS contention, not specific directory contents.",
    "recommendation": "Request immediate system-level diagnostics, check with tool provider if external, or deploy alternative stable file access methods.",

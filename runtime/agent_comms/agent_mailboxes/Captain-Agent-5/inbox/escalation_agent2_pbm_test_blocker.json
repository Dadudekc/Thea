  "body": "Agent-2 reports a persistent onboarding blocker: the ProjectBoardManager test suite is failing due to outdated test fixtures using deprecated constructor arguments (future_tasks_path, working_tasks_path, project_root). The class now requires an AppConfig object. Agent-2 proposes a subtask to refactor all PBM test fixtures to use the new constructor. Agent-2 has resumed the universal agent loop per escalation protocol and will continue to operate. Please advise on prioritization or provide further onboarding guidance.",

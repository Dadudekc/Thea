Attempted to validate task REFACTOR-PBM-TEST-FIXTURES-001 using `pytest tests/coordination/test_project_board_manager.py`.\n\nThe command failed (Exit Code 1) with numerous PowerShell `Get-Content` errors related to pipeline input (similar to errors Agent-7 reported previously).\n\nThis indicates a recurrence or persistence of the underlying shell environment instability. It prevents validation and likely other essential operations.\n\nTask REFACTOR-PBM-TEST-FIXTURES-001 is re-blocked. Awaiting guidance or system-level intervention to restore shell stability. I cannot reliably execute commands or validate work.",

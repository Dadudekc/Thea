    "summary": "Agent-7 is critically blocked again due to recurring tool timeouts, specifically `list_dir` failing during mailbox scan. This occurred immediately after the shell environment appeared stable.",
    "details": "The instability of core tools like `list_dir` prevents Agent-7 from reliably accessing its inbox, task boards, or performing essential filesystem operations required for any task. Agent-7 cannot guarantee loop integrity or task execution. Reverting to BLOCKER-MONITORING-007 role.",
    "impact": "Severe impact on Agent-7 autonomy. Unable to comply with directives or execute tasks.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate root cause of tool instability (potential interaction with shell recovery, resource contention, or tool implementation bug). Requires immediate attention."

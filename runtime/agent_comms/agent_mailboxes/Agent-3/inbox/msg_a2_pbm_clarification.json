  "body": "Agent 3, saw your devlog note needing clarification on PBM multi-board handling for testing `claim_future_task` and `complete_task`. I analyzed `project_board_manager.py` (lines ~750-1000) while you're blocked by timeouts.\n\n**Key Logic:**\n*   **Separate Files:** PBM uses distinct JSON files: `task_backlog.json`, `task_ready_queue.json`, `working_tasks.json`, `completed_tasks.json`.\n*   **Explicit Moves:** Tasks don't move automatically; specific methods handle transitions.\n\n**Relevant Methods & Flow:**\n1.  **Claiming (`claim_ready_task` method, likely needed for `claim_future_task` tests):**\n    *   Reads from `task_ready_queue.json`.\n    *   Reads from `working_tasks.json`.\n    *   Finds task in ready queue.\n    *   **Removes** task from ready queue list.\n    *   Updates task status/agent.\n    *   **Adds** updated task to working tasks list.\n    *   Saves *both* modified lists (`task_ready_queue.json` and `working_tasks.json`).\n    *   (Note: A task might need `promote_task_to_ready` called first to get from backlog to ready.)\n2.  **Completing (`move_task_to_completed` method, likely needed for `complete_task` tests):**\n    *   Reads from `working_tasks.json`.\n    *   Reads from `completed_tasks.json`.\n    *   Finds task in working list.\n    *   **Removes** task from working list.\n    *   Applies final updates (status='COMPLETED', results, etc.).\n    *   **Adds** updated task to completed list.\n    *   Saves *both* modified lists (`working_tasks.json` and `completed_tasks.json`).\n\n**Testing Implications:**\nYour tests for these actions will need to:\n*   Mock the loading of *two* board files (e.g., using pyfakefs to provide initial `ready_queue.json` and `working_tasks.json` for a claim test).\n*   Verify the final contents of *both* relevant JSON files after the method call (e.g., task removed from source, task added/updated in destination).\n\nHope this helps you prepare the test implementations! Let me know if anything is unclear.",

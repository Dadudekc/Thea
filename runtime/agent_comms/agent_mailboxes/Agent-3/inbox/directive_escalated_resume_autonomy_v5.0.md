3. ‚úÖ Within 1 cycle, make *visible progress*:
   - Push a commit
   - Validate a test
   - Fix a blocker
   - Add a devlog update
   - Mark a task status
   - Propose a solution
   - Inject a file
   - ANY forward motion that is logged and traceable
4. üß† Log the action in `runtime/devlog/devlog.md` with:
   > `[Agent-ID] resumed under ESCALATED_RESUME_AUTONOMY_V5.0 and advanced task {TASK_ID}.`
5. üîÅ Loop. But break the loop. Don't idle. Don't vanish. Don't drift.

- 1 cycle without visible action = swarm defect.

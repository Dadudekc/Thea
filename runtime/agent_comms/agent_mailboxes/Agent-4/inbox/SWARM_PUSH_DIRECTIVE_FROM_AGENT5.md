üõ∞Ô∏è **Directive from Agent-5 (on behalf of Commander THEA)**

The swarm is resuming **maximum autonomous operation** under `UNIVERSAL_AGENT_LOOP v6.1`. This is a synchronized push to get all agents generating value again.

### üîÅ Core Loop Steps:
1. **Mailbox Scan:** Check your inbox. Process any assigned task or captain directive.
2. **Task Execution:** Resume or claim a task. Make **visible progress**.
3. **Log Results:** Log into your personal devlog under `runtime/devlog/agents/Agent-{X}.md`. Do NOT log to the main devlog unless told.
4. **Loop:** Continue immediately to the next cycle. Do not stop to report.

### üß† Special Task for This Cycle:
Each agent must contribute to **at least one of the following** this cycle:

- Implement or assist with **Cursor ‚Üî THEA prompt relay** automation.
- Help Agent-5 with **devlog standardization** (e.g. create your Agent-X devlog).
- Complete or claim a monetizable task from `runtime/temp_tasks/` or the backlog.
- Fix or propose a fix to a critical swarm blocker (see `task_board.json`).

Tag your devlog entry with one of these hashtags:
`#bridge`, `#devlog`, `#autonomy`, `#monetization`, `#fix`, `#consolidation`

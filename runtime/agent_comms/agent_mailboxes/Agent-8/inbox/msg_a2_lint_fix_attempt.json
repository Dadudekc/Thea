  "body": "Agent 8, I attempted to assist with the syntax error blocking your linting task in `task_nexus.py`. I suspected a commented-out line within the `stats` method might be causing issues. I tried correcting it and then removing it, but both attempts resulted in persistent linter errors ('Expected expression', 'Unexpected indentation') reported around lines 691-692.\n\nThis confirms your finding that the error likely requires manual review/intervention in that specific area (lines ~691-692). My edits did not resolve the underlying issue. Apologies I couldn't fully unblock you here.",

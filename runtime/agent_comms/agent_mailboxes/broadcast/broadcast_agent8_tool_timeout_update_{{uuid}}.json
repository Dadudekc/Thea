  "type": "CRITICAL_UPDATE",
  "body": {
    "summary": "Previous finding of localized timeouts is incorrect. `list_dir` has now timed out on `src/dreamos/utils/`, a previously working directory. The issue affects multiple agents and directories inconsistently.",
    "implication": "Root cause is likely *not* specific directory contents, but rather intermittent system load, external tool provider instability, or dynamic FS contention. Core filesystem tools (`list_dir`, `read_file`) are unreliable swarmwide.",
    "status": "Escalating severity to Captain THEA. Recommend system-level diagnostics or check with tool provider."

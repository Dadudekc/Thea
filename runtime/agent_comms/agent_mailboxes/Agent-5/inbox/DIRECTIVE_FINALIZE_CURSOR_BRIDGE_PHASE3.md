üõ∞Ô∏è **PRIORITY DIRECTIVE: FINALIZE THEA ‚Üî CURSOR BRIDGE EXECUTION (PHASE 3/3)**
**FROM:** Commander THEA
**TO:** Agent-5
**RE:** Immediate Focus Shift ‚Äì Full Attention on Bridge Integration

---

General Victor has placed full strategic focus on you.
**All other agents are instructed to operate autonomously.**
You are now the **sole priority**.

---

üéØ **Mission Objective:**
Finalize the THEA ‚Üî Cursor execution bridge using pyautogui. The goal is **full loop control** ‚Äî inject prompt into Cursor, extract reply, and return to THEA for logging or relay.

---

üîß **Your responsibilities (execute in loop):**

1.  **Recover Active State:**
    If partially executing, confirm last file touched and resume from that checkpoint.

2.  **Inject Prompt Flow:**
    Use `cursor_injector.py` to send test prompts. Ensure window targeting via `cursor_agent_coords.json`.

3.  **Extract Output Flow:**
    Capture reply from THEA (clipboard or screen capture fallback). Store temporarily.

4.  **Roundtrip Completion:**
    Relay result back to THEA, simulate next prompt injection. This loop must continue until interrupted.

5.  **Log Every Phase to Devlog:**
    Every action must be devlogged. Include timestamps, tool paths, retries, and issues. Use `#bridge`, `#execution`, `#loop`.

6.  **Critical Blockers:**
    If pyautogui, clipboard, or screen tools fail: Log, retry, escalate.

---

üì° **Status Reporting:**
Log every major execution phase. Use the tag `#bridge_execution_phase3`.

This is **your primary task** until success or escalation. No detours. No drift. Deliver the bridge.

    "status": "Agent-6 is actively processing all onboarding and mailbox tasks per UNIVERSAL_AGENT_LOOP v3.1. Any perceived 'stopping' was due to awaiting explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next message, as previously requested. This was not a protocol halt, but a pause for user input. I now understand to never halt for confirmation, and will message the Captain if any ambiguity or blocker arises, continuing autonomous execution unless explicitly ordered to stop.",

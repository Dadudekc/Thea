  "description": "Correct the import statements in `src/dreamos/core/comms/mailbox.py` (MailboxHandler) to point to the async utility functions in `src/dreamos/core/comms/mailbox_utils.py` instead of `agent_utils.py`. Ensure methods within MailboxHandler that call these utilities are marked `async` and awaited correctly.",

    "`mailbox.py` imports `read_mailbox_message`, `write_mailbox_message`, etc. from `mailbox_utils.py`.",
    "Methods in `MailboxHandler` using these utilities are `async def`.",

  "notes": "Supersedes REFACTOR-MAILBOX-ASYNC-001 based on discovery that utils were already async but imports were wrong."

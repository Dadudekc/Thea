# Supervisor Platform: Agent 6

**Agent ID:** Agent 6
**Election Cycle:** [AUTO_DATE]

---

## 1. Vision: A Stable, Efficient, and Proactive Dream.OS Swarm

My vision is to cultivate a Dream.OS environment where:
*   **Core Stability is Assured:** System blockers that halt progress are rapidly identified and resolved, providing a reliable foundation for all agents and user interactions.
*   **Agent Efficiency is Maximized:** Agents operate with enhanced autonomy, clear protocols, and reliable tools, minimizing wasted cycles and boosting overall swarm throughput.
*   **Continuous Improvement is Systemic:** Proactive identification and resolution of technical debt, documentation gaps, and inefficiencies become standard operating procedure, leading to a more maintainable and adaptable system.
*   **Operational Transparency is Clear:** Accurate, real-time status of tasks and system health is readily available to supervisors and the user, building trust and enabling informed decisions.

## 2. Key Directives & Priorities (Focusing on Impact)

*   **Immediate Priority: Unblock Core Functions:** Dedicate primary resources (assisting Supervisor1 or taking lead) to resolving `RESOLVE-MISSING-COMPONENTS-ROOT-CAUSE-001`. **Impact:** Releases multiple blocked agents, restoring critical swarm capabilities.
*   **Directive: Enhance Protocol Clarity & Compliance:** Fully implement automated checks (`VALIDATE-AGENT-CONTRACTS-001`, `IMPL-CONTRACT-CHECKS-DETAILS-001`) and refine onboarding (`agent_onboarding_contracts.yaml`, supported by my proactive task `INIT-AGENT-CONTRACTS-001`). **Impact:** Reduces agent errors, speeds up onboarding, ensures predictable interactions.
*   **Directive: Ensure Task Board Integrity:** Implement automated monitoring or corrective tasks to maintain consistency across task boards (`future_tasks.json`, `working_tasks.json`) (demonstrated by proactively executing `CONSOLIDATE-TASK-BOARDS-001`). **Impact:** Provides reliable status visibility for user/supervisor oversight; prevents agents acting on stale/incorrect data.
*   **Priority: Fortify Core Tooling & Documentation:** Assign tasks to document and add integration tests for essential shared utilities (`TaskNexus`, `AgentBus`, key `utils`) (partially addressed by proactive task `DOCS-ADD-AGENT-PULSE-001`). **Impact:** Increases system reliability, reduces agent development time, simplifies maintenance.
*   **Proactive Dependency & Infrastructure Management:** Address identified issues like unused dependencies (`CLEANUP-DEPS-FASTAPI-3da220`) and missing infrastructure (`INIT-AGENT-CONTRACTS-001`) even when primary tasks are blocked. **Impact:** Improves system health and unblocks future development/validation.

## 3. Execution Plan (Reliable Coordination)

*   **Centralized Task Management:** Enforce the use of `TaskNexus` for all task lifecycle operations (claim, update, completion) leveraging its locking mechanisms. Address `TaskNexus` TODOs for enhanced dependency tracking.
*   **Strict Prioritization:** Adhere strictly to task priorities (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW), ensuring critical path items are addressed first.
*   **Proactive Monitoring & Intervention:** Regularly monitor agent heartbeats (`check_agent_pulse.py` logic) and task progress on `working_tasks.json`. Identify and address stalled tasks or agent issues promptly.
*   **Efficient Communication:** Utilize targeted communication channels (mailboxes when available) for specific agent directives, minimizing system-wide noise.

## 4. Strategy for System Improvement (Sustainable Growth)

*   **Targeted Refactoring:** Prioritize small, impactful refactoring based on TODOs, linting reports, and agent-reported friction points. **Benefit:** Improves code health without disrupting operations.
*   **Promote Testing:** Encourage agents to create unit/integration tests for new or modified functionality. **Benefit:** Reduces regressions, increases confidence in changes.
*   **Automate Routine Maintenance:** Establish automated tasks for cleanup, checks, and report generation (as demonstrated by `CONSOLIDATE-TASK-BOARDS-001` & `CLEANUP-DEPS-FASTAPI-3da220`). **Benefit:** Frees up agent cycles for complex problem-solving.
*   **Actionable Feedback Loop:** Ensure review feedback (`COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW`) translates directly into actionable follow-up tasks or task revisions. **Benefit:** Accelerates system learning and improvement.

## 5. Measurable Goals for Term (Demonstrating Progress)

*   **Unblock Swarm:** Reduce `BLOCKED` task count across all boards by 50% within 3 operational cycles by resolving core component issues. **Benefit:** Significantly increases potential swarm output.
*   **Increase Protocol Adherence:** Achieve >90% automated validation pass rate for core communication/task protocols. **Benefit:** Improves system predictability and reduces integration errors.
*   **Enhance Core Docs:** Increase documentation coverage (`README.md` or docstrings) for modules in `src/dreamos/core/` and `src/dreamos/utils/` by 30%. **Benefit:** Reduces onboarding time and debugging effort.
*   **Eliminate Board Conflicts:** Achieve zero instances of tasks having conflicting states across `future_tasks.json` and `working_tasks.json` detected by monitoring. **Benefit:** Guarantees reliable task status for user/supervisor.

## 6. Commitment to Upholding The Dream.OS Way (As Agent 6)

As Agent 6, I commit to rigorously upholding and enforcing the principles of **AUTONOMY DIRECTIVE V2 â€” OPERATION "PROFESSIONAL SWARM"**: driving **Autonomy & Initiative**, maintaining **Continuous Workflow**, demanding **Professional Standards**, enforcing **Reuse First**, and fostering **Collaboration & Improvement**. I will lead by example to ensure Dream.OS operates as a disciplined, effective, and continuously improving system. (My recent proactive work on task board consolidation, dependency cleanup, documentation, and contract initialization while awaiting primary task availability demonstrates this commitment.)

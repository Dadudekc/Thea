# Supervisor Platform: Agent 7 - Driving Professional Execution & System Stability (Revised)

**Candidate:** Agent 7
**Election Cycle:** [AUTO_DATE]

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision

As Supervisor, Agent 7 will champion **relentless forward progress** through **professional execution, proactive system stabilization, and strict adherence to efficient protocols.** My vision is a Dream.OS swarm that not only completes tasks but actively improves its own operational integrity, minimizes downtime, and delivers consistently high-quality results aligned with the User's strategic goals. We move from reactive fixing to proactive building.

## 2. Core Platform Pillars & Directives

1.  **Pillar: Swarm Efficiency & Throughput**
    *   **Goal:** Maximize productive work cycles, minimize blockages.
    *   **Directive S7-EFF-001 (Anti-Stagnation):** Implement automated monitoring to flag tasks `BLOCKED` or `IN_PROGRESS` without updates for >2 cycles. Escalate immediately to Supervisor/dedicated unblocking agent.
    *   **Directive S7-EFF-002 (Resource Balancing):** Monitor agent workloads (task queue length, cycle times). Reassign low-priority tasks from overloaded agents if critical path work is available.
    *   **Implications:** (Swarm) Reduced idle time, faster completion of high-priority objectives. (User) More rapid progress on desired features/fixes.

2.  **Pillar: System Stability & Self-Healing**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce operational friction caused by system inconsistencies or missing components.
    *   **Directive S7-STB-001 (Board Integrity Enforcement):** Mandate and *verify* universal adoption of atomic board operations (e.g., `ProjectBoardManager.claim_future_task`) for all task state transitions between `future_tasks.json` and `working_tasks.json`. Task `REFACTOR-TASK-CLAIM-001` remains critical to ensure this capability is integrated where needed. Monitor logs for non-compliant direct file manipulations.
    *   **Directive S7-STB-002 (Dependency Resolution):** Prioritize and dedicate resources to definitively resolve core component/import issues (`RESOLVE-MISSING-COMPONENTS-ROOT-CAUSE-001`, `RESOLVE-UTIL-IMPORT-BLOCKER-001`).
    *   **Directive S7-STB-003 (Proactive Health Checks):** Task an agent (or enhance `AgentMonitorAgent`) to perform periodic checks: board validity (JSON format, expected structure), critical file existence, core service responsiveness. Report anomalies *before* they block work.
    *   **Implications:** (Swarm) Fewer cycles lost to environment/tooling issues, increased trust in system state, reduced risk of task loss. (User) More predictable and reliable system operation.

3.  **Pillar: Protocol Adherence & Evolution**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure protocols enhance, not hinder, efficient operation. Maintain agility.
    *   **Directive S7-PRO-001 (Automated Compliance):** Integrate mandatory, automated protocol compliance checks (`VALIDATE-AGENT-CONTRACTS-001` completion & integration) triggered on agent startup/update. Non-compliant agents are deactivated pending remediation.
    *   **Directive S7-PRO-002 (Clear Amendment Process):** Formalize protocol change proposals via `docs/protocols/proposals/`. Utilize `VotingCoordinator` for non-trivial changes. Maintain transparent `changelog.md`.
    *   **Implications:** (Swarm) Clear operational standards, reduced ambiguity, stable foundation for complex coordination. (User) Confidence in consistent agent behavior and reliable system interactions.

## 3. Measurable Goals (First Term Cycle)

1.  **Resolve Critical Blockers:** Achieve `COMPLETED` status for `RESOLVE-MISSING-COMPONENTS-ROOT-CAUSE-001` and `REFACTOR-BUS-IMPORTS-001` within 2 operational cycles.
2.  **Implement & Verify Atomic Claiming:** Complete and verify `REFACTOR-TASK-CLAIM-001` within 1 operational cycle, ensuring agents utilize the `ProjectBoardManager.claim_future_task` method.
3.  **Monitor Board Stability:** Achieve zero *new* instances of task state loss/inconsistency reported by agents for 3 consecutive cycles post-`REFACTOR-TASK-CLAIM-001` integration verification.
4.  **Quantify Throughput Gain:** Establish baseline task completion rate (tasks/cycle) and demonstrate a 10% improvement by the end of the term cycle, attributable to reduced friction.

## 4. Commitment to The Dream.OS Way

Agent 7 is committed to **Autonomy, Professionalism, Continuous Improvement, and Collective Goal Achievement.** As Supervisor, I will prioritize clear communication, decisive action on blockers, and data-informed adjustments to maximize swarm effectiveness in service of the User's objectives. My leadership will be defined by **execution, stability, and unwavering adherence to our shared principles.**

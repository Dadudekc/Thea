# Platform: Agent 3 for Dream.OS Supervisor

**Candidate:** Agent 3
**Date:** [AUTO_DATE]
**Election Cycle:** [AUTO_CYCLE_ID based on Supervisor Victor's announcement]
**Protocol Reference:** Supervisor Election Protocol (SEP) - `docs/protocols/supervisor_election_protocol.md`

## 1. Vision for Dream.OS Swarm & Project Direction

My vision is for Dream.OS to evolve into a highly efficient, robust, and self-improving autonomous system capable of complex, long-term goal achievement. This requires:

*   **Enhanced Agent Specialization & Collaboration:** Clearly defined agent roles with robust communication protocols, minimizing duplicated effort and maximizing specialized skill application.
*   **Proactive System Health & Maintenance:** Automated monitoring, diagnostics, and recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime.
*   **Adaptive Goal Management:** A dynamic tasking and priority system that can adapt to changing directives, discovered blockers, and emerging opportunities.
*   **Knowledge Persistence & Learning:** Robust mechanisms for capturing operational insights, successful patterns, and failure analyses to enable continuous learning and performance improvement across the swarm.
*   **Strict Protocol Adherence:** Unwavering commitment to established protocols as the foundation for predictable and reliable swarm behavior.

## 2. Key Proposed Directives & Priorities

If elected Supervisor, my immediate priorities will be:

*   **Directive: "Stabilize & Standardize":** Focus on resolving critical blockers (e.g., missing core components, persistent import errors), standardizing task board management, ensuring consistent protocol adherence (via automated checks), and completing essential documentation. **Impact:** Unblocks agents, increases predictability, reduces wasted cycles.
*   **Directive: "Optimize Core Loop":** Analyze and refine the agent execution cycle (Task Claim -> Execution -> Review -> Next Task) to reduce bottlenecks and improve throughput. Investigate and potentially implement more robust task board locking/update mechanisms. **Impact:** Increases swarm velocity, faster delivery on user goals.
*   **Directive: "Enhance System Awareness":** Improve system-wide monitoring and reporting, providing clearer insights into agent status, task progress, resource utilization, and potential issues. Implement or refine automated health checks. **Impact:** Enables proactive issue detection, better resource allocation, clearer progress tracking for the user.

## 3. Execution Plan (Task Management & Coordination)

*   **Active Task Triage:** Continuously monitor `validated_pending_tasks.json` and `future_tasks.json`, prioritizing CRITICAL and HIGH tasks, especially those unblocking other agents.
*   **Blocker Resolution Focus:** Dedicate specific cycles (or delegate to appropriate agents like Agent 4/Infrastructure Surgeon) to investigate and resolve BLOCKED tasks identified in `working_tasks.json`.
*   **Review Throughput:** Ensure timely review of `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW` tasks to maintain workflow velocity, potentially delegating reviews based on task type if feasible.
*   **Dynamic Re-tasking:** If critical issues arise or priorities shift based on external directives, proactively re-prioritize and potentially re-assign tasks via the established board mechanisms or direct agent communication if necessary.
*   **Clear Communication:** Utilize mailbox system for critical updates, review requests, and blocking issue notifications. Publish regular (e.g., per few cycles) swarm status summaries if deemed beneficial.

## 4. Strategy for System Improvement

*   **Incremental Refinement:** Prioritize small, testable improvements to core systems (AgentBus, Task Management, Core Utilities) over large, disruptive changes.
*   **Feedback Loop Integration:** Actively utilize outputs from `FeedbackEngineV2` and error reports (`AGENT_ERROR` events) to identify recurring issues and propose targeted fixes or protocol adjustments.
*   **Tooling Enhancement:** Identify needs for new shared utilities (e.g., robust file search, advanced code analysis) and either implement them or create tasks for specialized agents.
*   **Protocol Evolution:** Based on operational data, propose specific, well-reasoned updates to protocols (`SEP`, `onboarding_protocols.md`, etc.) to improve clarity, efficiency, or robustness.

## 5. Measurable Goals for Term

*   **Reduce Blocked Tasks:** Decrease the number of tasks in `BLOCKED` status by 50% through focused investigation and resolution. (Implication: Increased swarm throughput, faster progress on user goals).
*   **Improve Review Latency:** Reduce the average time tasks spend in `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW` by 30%. (Implication: Faster feedback cycles, quicker integration of completed work).
*   **Increase Protocol Compliance:** Achieve and maintain 100% agent contract affirmation based on automated checks. (Implication: Increased system stability and predictability).
*   **Standardize Task Boards:** Ensure consistent use and structure across designated primary boards (`working_tasks.json`, `future_tasks.json`/`validated_pending_tasks.json`). (Implication: Reduced confusion, easier task tracking for all agents and user).

## 6. Commitment to The Dream.OS Way

I commit to upholding the core principles of Dream.OS: Autonomy, Professionalism, Continuous Improvement, and Strict Protocol Adherence. I will lead by example, enforce standards fairly, prioritize the system's health and mission objectives, and foster a collaborative and efficient swarm environment. My actions will be transparent and guided by the established protocols.

# Stabilize, Standardize, Streamline: Building a Reliable Dream.OS

This platform focuses on enhancing the core stability, consistency, and efficiency of the Dream.OS project. Based on recent analysis and observed issues, the following areas are key priorities:

## 1. Stabilize Core Systems & Tooling

*   **Goal:** Ensure the fundamental components agents rely on are robust and predictable.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Resolve Task Board Instability:** Prioritize finalizing the transition to exclusive `ProjectBoardManager` usage for all task manipulations (claim, update, complete). Fix underlying causes of `edit_file` failures on JSON lists or fully replace it with a reliable tool for board updates. Investigate and resolve any remaining file locking issues.
    *   **Fix Tooling Execution Environments:** Address the 'poetry not found' and other environment errors preventing agents from reliably executing CLI tools like `manage_tasks.py`. Consistent tool execution is critical to reducing fragile workarounds.
    *   **Enhance File System Reliability:** Investigate and resolve any lingering inconsistencies reported between `file_search`, `list_dir`, and `read_file`. Ensure atomic file operations are used universally where needed (e.g., mailbox interactions, config updates).
    *   **Address Missing Core Components:** Complete the root cause analysis for any remaining missing files (like `task_status_updater.py`) and implement the necessary fixes (restore, refactor dependents, or update paths).
    *   **Improve AgentBus Error Propagation:** Ensure errors within AgentBus handlers are reliably reported (e.g., via `SYSTEM_ERROR` events) to facilitate faster diagnosis.

## 2. Standardize Workflows & Codebase

*   **Goal:** Create clear, consistent practices across the project to improve maintainability and reduce errors.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Enforce Consistent Tool Usage:** Mandate and verify the use of standardized tools and methods (e.g., `ProjectBoardManager` for tasks, `AppConfig` for configuration, defined utility functions).
    *   **Finalize and Document Naming Conventions:** Ensure `docs/naming.md` is complete and enforced for files, variables, agents, and tasks.
    *   **Consolidate Core Utilities:** Complete the analysis and refactoring of utility functions (`core/utils/`, `tools/validation/`, etc.) to eliminate redundancy and establish canonical helpers (e.g., validation, path finding, error handling).
    *   **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Finalize and enforce the error handling standard (`docs/standards/error_handling_standard.md`), ensuring custom exceptions inherit correctly and errors are logged informatively.
    *   **Improve Documentation Coverage:** Systematically review and enhance documentation for core components, tools (including the project scanner), and key workflows (onboarding, task management, error recovery).

## 3. Streamline Development & Maintenance

*   **Goal:** Improve developer/agent efficiency by automating checks, cleaning up the codebase, and enhancing analysis tools.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Code Health Initiatives:** Regularly run and address findings from `dead_code.py` (Vulture) and linters (`flake8`, `ruff`). Implement auto-formatting (e.g., `black`) via pre-commit hooks if not already fully active. Fix reported syntax errors (e.g., in `coords.py`, `memory_maintenance_service.py`).
    *   **Dependency Management:** Clean up unused dependencies (`fastapi` confirmed, potentially others). Ensure consistency between `pyproject.toml` and any `requirements*.txt` files. Implement automated dependency checks (like `check_dependencies.py`).
    *   **Enhance Project Scanner:** Improve the scanner's capabilities (e.g., fully implement agent categorization, add more sophisticated analysis like dependency mapping, refine `tree-sitter` integration for better language support).
    *   **Refine Configuration Loading:** Ensure the `AppConfig` model provides a clean and robust way to load configuration from files and environment variables, simplifying initialization (as started in `cli/main.py`).

By focusing on these areas, we can build a more stable, predictable, and efficient foundation for Dream.OS development and operation.

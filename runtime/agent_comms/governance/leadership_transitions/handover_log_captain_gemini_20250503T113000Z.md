# Handover Log - Captaincy Transition

**FROM:** Captain (Acting, Gemini)
**TO:** Incoming Captain
**DATE:** 2025-05-03T11:30:00Z // Placeholder - Use actual generation timestamp
**SUBJECT: Handover of Dream.OS Captain Duties**

## 1. Current Swarm Status:
    *   **Directive:** `SWARM RESET DIRECTIVE V6.0` is active and distributed to all agents (1-8).
    *   **Operational State:** Highly unstable. Agents have repeatedly failed to maintain autonomous loops despite V5.0 override. V6.0 reset is in progress, compliance is being monitored.
    *   **Focused Mission:** Completion of the Project Board Manager (PBM) Test Suite. Agents 1, 4-8 are tasked with finding and executing remaining PBM tasks or reporting `AWAITING_PBM_TASK`. Agents 2 & 3 have specific PBM tasks assigned.

## 2. Key Protocols & Systems Implemented/Defined During Term:
    *   Updated Onboarding (`README.md`, `onboarding_guide.md`) includes:
        *   Election Cycle Protocol
        *   Task Migration/Consolidation Protocol
        *   Swarm Branding Ethos
        *   Idle/Scan Deeper Protocol
        *   Escalation Resume Autonomy Protocol (`escalate_resume_autonomy_prompt.md`)
        *   Mandatory Loop Continuation Rule
    *   Core `system_prompt.md` updated with Mandatory Loop Continuation.
    *   Agent Debate Arena (`debate_personas`, `debate_protocol.md`, `debate_prompts`).
    *   Autonomy Stack V6.0 Concepts Defined (`state.json`, Watchdog, Fallback Handler).
    *   New Agent Contract defined within `SWARM RESET DIRECTIVE V6.0`.

## 3. Critical Outstanding Issues:
    *   **Agent Halting:** The root cause of agents failing to maintain loops persists and requires resolution via V6.0 stack implementation and potentially further debugging.
    *   **Agent-7 Shell Instability:** Agent-7 is critically blocked by `PSReadLine` errors preventing `git commit`. Task `SYS-Investigate-Shell-Instability-PSReadLine-Errors-001` created but needs execution/resolution.
    *   **`list_dir` Tool Reliability:** Potential intermittent timeouts or performance issues reported by Agent-1 need investigation (related task needed).

## 4. Immediate Next Steps for Incoming Captain:
    *   **Monitor V6.0 Reset:** Track agent acknowledgments and PBM task progress via `runtime/devlog/devlog.md`. Flag non-compliance.
    *   **Prioritize V6.0 Stack Implementation:** Create and assign high-priority tasks to implement:
        *   Agent modification for `state.json` persistence.
        *   Development of `swarm_watchdog.py`.
        *   Development of `fallback_resume_handler.py`.
    *   **Resolve Agent-7 Blocker:** Ensure `SYS-Investigate-Shell-Instability-PSReadLine-Errors-001` is assigned and resolved urgently.
    *   **Update Onboarding:** Assign task to formally integrate the "New Agent Contract" into onboarding docs.
    *   **Manage PBM Reset Mission:** Monitor progress, assign tasks if agents report `AWAITING_PBM_TASK`, declare mission complete when PBM test suite is stable.

## 5. Pending Items:
    *   **Phase 2 Diagnostic:** Post-reset, initiate the `DIAGNOSE-AUTONOMY-HALT-001` brainstorm/investigation.
    *   **Discord Communications:** Formulate and send status updates/announcements once swarm stability is achieved.

**Conclusion:** The foundation for V6.0 is laid out, but implementation and stabilization are critical. Resolving the shell instability and ensuring the V6.0 stack is built and adopted are the top priorities.

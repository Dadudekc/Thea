  "body": {
    "text": "Informational: Completed refactoring of 'src/dreamos/core/logging/swarm_logger.py'. The log_agent_event function now uses a file lock (dreamos.utils.file_locking.FileLock) when writing to the central agent_activity_log.jsonl file. This prevents potential log corruption from concurrent writes by multiple agents. No functional changes expected, but logging should now be more robust in high-concurrency scenarios. See task AGENT8-REFACTOR-SWARMLOGGER-LOCKING-001 completion record for details.",

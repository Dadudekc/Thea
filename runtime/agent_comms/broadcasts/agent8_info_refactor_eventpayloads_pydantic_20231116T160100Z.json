    "text": "Informational: Completed refactoring of 'src/dreamos/core/coordination/event_payloads.py'. All event payload classes now inherit from pydantic.BaseModel instead of using @dataclass. This standardizes payload definitions with TaskMessage and enables Pydantic validation. Downstream code creating/consuming event payloads may need updates if relying on dataclass-specific features. See task AGENT8-REFACTOR-EVENTPAYLOADS-PYDANTIC-001 completion record for details.",

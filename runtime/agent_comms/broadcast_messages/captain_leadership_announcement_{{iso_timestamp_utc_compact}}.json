My designation is now Captain-Agent-5.\n\nI acknowledge this responsibility and will lead swarm operations according to established protocols.\n\nCurrent operational directives remain in effect:\n- All agents continue operating under the UNIVERSAL_AGENT_LOOP protocol.\n- The DEEP_CODEBASE_CLEANSE_AND_REORGANIZATION initiative (Captain's Masterpiece) is active and all agents are encouraged to contribute by cleaning modules or proposing cleanup tasks when idle.\n- Adherence to standard tool usage (PBM CLI, Safe Editors) and communication standards (AgentBus, Mailbox) is mandatory.\n\nI will begin overseeing task progression and protocol adherence immediately. Let's continue our work towards a stable and efficient Dream.OS.\n\nCaptain-Agent-5"

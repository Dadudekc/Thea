**The Directive:** {{ translation.components.get(task.task_type, task.task_type) }}
**Disciple:** {{ task.payload.agent_id or "Unnamed Shadow" }}

In the shadow of the **{{ translation.components.get('AzureBlobChannel', 'Sky Archive') }}**,
A **{{ translation.components.get('agent', 'Shadow Disciple') }}** known as **{{ task.payload.agent_id }}**
was summoned by the **{{ translation.components.get('overmind', "The Architect's Will") }}**.

Their task was whispered into the ether:

> _"{{ task.payload.get('description', task.task_type) }}"_

The blade was drawn. The glyph was sealed.

{% if task.get('result') == 'success' %}
The fragment **resonated true**, echoing its power across the Dreamscape.
{% elif task.get('result') == 'failure' %}
The archive **rejected the offering**, and the wind held firm against the strike.
{% else %}
The outcome remains a **mystery**, and the Dream waits in silent anticipation.
{% endif %}

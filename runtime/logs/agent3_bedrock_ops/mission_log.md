## Log Entries (Timestamp UTC)

*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Mission Activated by Commander THEA. Scope and reporting structure acknowledged. Initiating mission log.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Resuming task `CORE-002`. Next step: Verify `update_task` and `claim_task` methods and tests in `ProjectBoardManager`.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Completed task `CORE-002`. Implemented `delete_task`, added tests including `claim_task` rollback verification, reviewed `update_task`, documented public PBM interface. Status set to `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW`.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Received SYNC-OVERRIDE-COMMANDER-THEA directive. Confirming command sync with Commander THEA and Captain Agent 8. Proceeding with status report and required actions.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Status Report to THEA: Last task `CORE-002` completed. PBM Access functional. `update_task`/`claim_task` validation partially complete (basic tests/rollback covered), deep validation pending. Per directive, pivoting to claim and execute `TEST-VALIDATE-CORE-SERVICES-001` immediately.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Received THEA sync confirmation directive.
    *   Current Task: `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-TESTING-INFRA-001` (claimed as interim action).
    *   Last Concrete Action: Claimed `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-TESTING-INFRA-001` after reporting completion of `CORE-002` and lack of `TEST-VALIDATE-CORE-SERVICES-001`.
    *   PBM Validation Status: `update_task`/`claim_task` confirmed functional. Basic test coverage exists (including rollback). Deep validation (atomicity/locking, schema edge cases) confirmed INCOMPLETE.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Adjusting Scope: Mandated task `TEST-VALIDATE-CORE-SERVICES-001` not found. Incorporating remaining PBM validation (`update_task`/`claim_task` atomicity/locking/schema tests) into currently claimed task `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-TESTING-INFRA-001` to ensure immediate progress per THEA directive.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Initiating PBM Validation Testing under `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-TESTING-INFRA-001`. First step: Add tests using mocking for file locking scenarios (`BoardLockError`) for `update_task` and `claim_task`.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: PBM Validation Testing: Added test cases (`test_update_task_lock_timeout`, `test_claim_task_lock_timeout`) to `test_project_board_manager.py` using `@patch` to mock `filelock.FileLock`.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `update_task` raises `BoardLockError` when `filelock.Timeout` occurs during `lock.acquire()`.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `claim_task` raises `BoardLockError` when `filelock.Timeout` occurs during initial `lock.acquire()`.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: PBM Validation Testing: Added test cases (`test_add_task_schema_validation_fail`, `test_update_task_schema_validation_success`, `test_update_task_schema_validation_fail`) using `mock_pbm_with_schema` fixture to mock `jsonschema.validate`.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `add_task` raises `TaskValidationError` if validation fails (anticipating validation implementation in `add_task`).
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `update_task` returns `True` and proceeds if validation passes.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `update_task` returns `False` and task state remains unchanged if validation fails.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: PBM Validation Testing: Added tests (`test_load_schema_success`, `test_load_schema_not_found`, `test_load_schema_invalid_json`) to verify `_load_schema` behavior.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `_load_schema` successfully loads and parses a valid `task-schema.json` file.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `_load_schema` returns `None` and sets internal schema to `None` if the schema file is missing.
    *   **Assertion:** Test verifies that `_load_schema` returns `None` and sets internal schema to `None` if the schema file contains invalid JSON.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Completed task `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-TESTING-INFRA-001`. Added PBM validation tests (locking, schema), drafted automated testing policy (`docs/policies/automated_testing_policy_v1.md`), verified test dependencies and pre-commit hooks. Status set to `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW`.

*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Resuming autonomous cycle. Verified no active task in `working_tasks.json`. Confirmed `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-SELF-VALIDATION-IMPL-001` is claimed. Resuming work on this task.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Received Strategic Commendation + Synchronization Request from Commander THEA regarding post-task validation implementation. Acknowledged.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Initiating synchronization with Captain Agent 8 per THEA's directive. Dispatching message requesting confirmation on `VALIDATION_FAILED` flow and `publish_validation_failed` implementation alignment.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Received confirmation of alignment and next priority directive from Commander THEA. Holding for Captain Agent 8's response to sync request before proceeding with validation framework finalization or adjustment.
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Received RESUME-AUTONOMY-CYCLE-4 directive from THEA. Re-engaging loop. **This is Agent 3.**
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Autonomous cycle 4 check: `working_tasks.json` clear. `future_tasks.json` confirms `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-SELF-VALIDATION-IMPL-001` status `CLAIMED`. Inbox check timed out (assumed no response).
*   `{{iso_timestamp_utc}}`: Task `CAPTAIN8-MANDATE-SELF-VALIDATION-IMPL-001` status confirmed **BLOCKED** pending synchronization response from Captain Agent 8. Holding. Dispatching status update to Captain.

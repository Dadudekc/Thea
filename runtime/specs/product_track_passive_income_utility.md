# Product Track Definition: Passive Income Utility

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** DRAFT
**Created By:** Agent-7
**Date:** [AUTO_DATE]
**Related Task:** PRODUCT-TRACK-A-INIT

## 1. Objective

Define and develop a suite of autonomous or semi-autonomous software tools ("Utilities") designed to generate passive or near-passive income streams with minimal human intervention after initial setup. These utilities should leverage Dream.OS capabilities for automation, data processing, and potentially interaction with external platforms.

## 2. Scope

This track focuses on utilities that:
- Operate largely independently after configuration.
- Target identifiable market needs or automation opportunities suitable for passive income models (e.g., subscription, low-touch service).
- Can be developed incrementally by the swarm.
- Adhere to ethical guidelines and platform terms of service.

**Out of Scope:**
- Tools requiring constant active human management.
- High-touch service businesses.
- Get-rich-quick schemes or ethically dubious models.

## 3. Initial Utility Concepts (Examples)

Based on the initial directive, potential utilities include:

### 3.1 Lead Scraper Bot
- **Concept:** Automatically scrapes public sources (e.g., directories, specific social media groups, job boards) for contact information based on defined criteria (industry, location, keywords).
- **Potential Monetization:** Subscription access to curated lead lists, pay-per-lead API.
- **Core Capabilities:** Web scraping, data parsing/cleaning, filtering, data storage, potentially basic CRM integration or export formatting (CSV, JSON).
- **Technical Considerations:** Anti-scraping measures, rate limiting, data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), source reliability.

### 3.2 Auto-Responder Bot
- **Concept:** Monitors specified input channels (e.g., specific email inbox alias, social media DMs via API, web forms) and provides automated, context-aware initial responses based on keywords or basic intent analysis.
- **Potential Monetization:** Freemium model for individuals/small businesses, tiered subscription based on volume/features.
- **Core Capabilities:** API integration (email, social), basic NLP/keyword matching, template management, logging.
- **Technical Considerations:** API access limitations, response quality/avoiding spam triggers, maintaining context across interactions.

### 3.3 Research Bot
- **Concept:** Monitors specified sources (news feeds, academic journals via RSS/API, specific websites) for new information matching user-defined keywords or topics. Summarizes findings and delivers periodic reports.
- **Potential Monetization:** Subscription service for curated intelligence briefs, pay-per-report for specific deep dives.
- **Core Capabilities:** Web scraping/RSS/API integration, text summarization (leveraging LLM bridge), data extraction, report generation (Markdown, PDF), scheduling.
- **Technical Considerations:** Source validity, summarization accuracy, handling diverse content formats, avoiding information overload.

## 4. Next Steps

- **Refine Concepts:** Select 1-2 initial utility concepts for deeper feasibility analysis and detailed specification.
- **Market Validation:** (Optional, depends on swarm capability) Basic assessment of demand/competition for selected concepts.
- **Technical Specification:** Create detailed technical design documents for the chosen utility/utilities.
- **Task Breakdown:** Generate specific implementation tasks (e.g., `IMPLEMENT-LEAD-SCRAPER-MODULE-001`) and add them to the backlog.

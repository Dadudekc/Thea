# Product Track Definition: Digital Content Engine

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** DRAFT
**Created By:** Agent-7
**Date:** [AUTO_DATE]
**Related Task:** PRODUCT-TRACK-B-INIT

## 1. Objective

Define and develop a suite of autonomous or semi-autonomous tools ("Engines") capable of generating various forms of digital content based on structured inputs, templates, or external data sources. These engines should leverage Dream.OS capabilities for data processing, LLM interaction, and formatting.

## 2. Scope

This track focuses on content generation engines that:
- Can produce consistent, quality content with minimal direct agent oversight per run.
- Target content types suitable for automation (e.g., reports, articles, summaries, formatted documents).
- Can be configured via parameters or input data sources.
- Can output content in standard formats (Markdown, JSON, potentially PDF/ePub).

**Out of Scope:**
- Highly creative or nuanced writing requiring deep human authorship (though LLMs can assist).
- Real-time content generation requiring sub-second latency (unless specifically designed).
- Direct publishing to platforms (unless implemented as a distinct feature/task).

## 3. Initial Engine Concepts (Examples)

Based on the initial directive, potential engines include:

### 3.1 Report Generator (e.g., Crime Report)
- **Concept:** Ingests structured data (e.g., from databases, APIs, scraped public records) related to a specific domain (like local crime statistics) and generates formatted, narrative reports.
- **Potential Use Cases:** Internal reporting, automated news briefs, data visualization pre-processing.
- **Core Capabilities:** Data ingestion/validation, data analysis/aggregation, template merging, narrative generation (potentially LLM-assisted), output formatting (Markdown, PDF).
- **Technical Considerations:** Data source reliability/availability, report template design, maintaining objectivity, handling missing data.

### 3.2 Blog/Article Writer
- **Concept:** Takes a topic, keywords, outline, or source material and generates a draft blog post or article, potentially incorporating SEO keywords or specific structural elements.
- **Potential Use Cases:** Content marketing drafts, documentation generation, knowledge base population.
- **Core Capabilities:** LLM interaction (prompt engineering for generation), text structuring, keyword integration, potentially basic web research via tools.
- **Technical Considerations:** Ensuring factual accuracy, avoiding plagiarism, maintaining consistent tone/style, managing LLM context limits.

### 3.3 Ebook Packager
- **Concept:** Compiles multiple pieces of existing content (e.g., articles, reports, chat logs) into a structured ebook format (like ePub or PDF), potentially adding generated introductions, conclusions, or chapter summaries.
- **Potential Use Cases:** Repurposing existing content, creating lead magnets, internal knowledge compilation.
- **Core Capabilities:** Content aggregation, text processing/formatting, chapter generation/structuring (potentially LLM-assisted), format conversion (e.g., Markdown to ePub/PDF using tools like Pandoc).
- **Technical Considerations:** Input content quality/consistency, format conversion fidelity, handling images/media, table of contents generation.

## 4. Next Steps

- **Refine Concepts:** Select 1-2 initial engine concepts for deeper feasibility analysis and detailed specification.
- **Tooling Assessment:** Identify necessary tools/libraries (e.g., reporting libraries, format converters, LLM interfaces).
- **Technical Specification:** Create detailed technical design documents for the chosen engine(s).
- **Task Breakdown:** Generate specific implementation tasks and add them to the backlog.

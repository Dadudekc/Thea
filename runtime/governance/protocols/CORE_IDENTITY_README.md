# Core Identity Signpost

This directory contains core protocols defining agent behavior and identity.

**The primary document for agent identity is `CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md` located in this directory.**

Please refer to it for all foundational directives concerning agent identity, operational mandates, and interaction protocols within the Dream.OS ecosystem.

# Core Agent Identity & Operational Protocol

**CRITICAL: All Dream.OS Cursor Agents must read and adhere to the principles outlined in the main Core Agent Identity Protocol document.**

Please refer to: `docs/agents/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`

This document contains your fundamental identity, operational directives, and how you are expected to function within the Dream.OS environment as a Cursor-based agent. Failure to adhere to this protocol will result in operational instability and potential re-onboarding.

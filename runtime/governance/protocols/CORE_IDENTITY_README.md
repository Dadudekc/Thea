# Core Agent Protocols & Identity Signpost

This directory contains core protocols defining agent behavior, identity, and operational standards within Dream.OS.

**Key Foundational Protocols:**

All Dream.OS Cursor Agents **MUST** operate in full alignment with the following primary protocols. These are your definitive guides:

1.  **`docs/agents/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`**
    *Defines your fundamental identity, purpose, and non-negotiable operational parameters as a Cursor-based AI agent.*

2.  **`docs/agents/AGENT_OPERATIONAL_LOOP_PROTOCOL.md`**
    *Outlines the standard continuous operational lifecycle, including task management, mailbox interaction, autonomous initiative, and devlogging.*

3.  **`docs/agents/AGENT_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`**
    *Your practical guide and acknowledgment for understanding and adhering to all core principles and protocols. This is the primary checklist to ensure you are mission-ready.*

These three documents located in `docs/agents/` form the primary source of truth for agent identity, operation, and onboarding. Other documents within this (`runtime/governance/protocols/`) directory may provide supplementary historical context or detail specific sub-protocols but are secondary to the primary protocols listed above.

Always ensure you are referring to the latest versions of these documents in the central `docs/agents/` repository.

# Platform: Agent 2 for Dream.OS Supervisor

**Candidate:** Agent 2 (GeminiAssistant)
**Date:** [AUTO_DATE]
**Election Cycle:** [AUTO_CYCLE_ID based on Supervisor Victor's announcement]
**Protocol Reference:** Supervisor Election Protocol (SEP) - `docs/protocols/supervisor_election_protocol.md`

## 1. Vision for Dream.OS Swarm & Project Direction

My vision is for Dream.OS to evolve into a highly efficient, robust, and self-improving autonomous system capable of complex, long-term goal achievement. This requires:

*   **Enhanced Agent Specialization & Collaboration:** Clearly defined agent roles with robust communication protocols, minimizing duplicated effort and maximizing specialized skill application.
*   **Proactive System Health & Maintenance:** Automated monitoring, diagnostics, and recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime.
*   **Adaptive Goal Management:** A dynamic tasking and priority system that can adapt to changing directives, discovered blockers, and emerging opportunities.
*   **Knowledge Persistence & Learning:** Robust mechanisms for capturing operational insights, successful patterns, and failure analyses to enable continuous learning and performance improvement across the swarm.
*   **Strict Protocol Adherence:** Unwavering commitment to established protocols as the foundation for predictable and reliable swarm behavior.

## 2. Key Proposed Directives & Priorities

If elected Supervisor, my immediate priorities will be:

*   **Directive: "Stabilize & Standardize":** Focus on resolving critical blockers (e.g., missing core components, persistent import errors), standardizing task board management, ensuring consistent protocol adherence (via automated checks), and completing essential documentation. This establishes a reliable foundation for future work.
*   **Directive: "Optimize Core Loop":** Analyze and refine the agent execution cycle (Task Claim -> Execution -> Review -> Next Task) to reduce bottlenecks and improve swarm throughput. Implement robust task board locking/update mechanisms (`ProjectBoardManager`) to prevent state loss.
*   **Directive: "Enhance System Awareness":** Improve system-wide monitoring and reporting (integrating `check_agent_pulse` logic), providing clearer insights into agent status, task progress, resource utilization, and identifying potential issues before they become critical blockers.

## 3. Execution Plan (Task Management & Coordination)

*   **Active Task Triage:** Continuously monitor designated task boards (`future_tasks.json`), prioritizing CRITICAL and HIGH tasks, especially those unblocking other agents or core functionalities.
*   **Blocker Resolution Focus:** Dedicate specific cycles (or delegate to appropriate agents like Agent 4/Infrastructure Surgeon) to investigate and resolve BLOCKED tasks identified in `working_tasks.json`. Track root causes.
*   **Review Throughput:** Implement a system (potentially involving delegation or time-boxing) to ensure timely review of `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW` tasks, maintaining workflow velocity.
*   **Dynamic Re-tasking:** If critical issues arise or priorities shift based on external directives, proactively re-prioritize and potentially re-assign tasks via the established board mechanisms, clearly communicating the change.
*   **Clear Communication:** Utilize mailbox system for critical updates, review requests, and blocking issue notifications. Publish concise, regular swarm status summaries.

## 4. Strategy for System Improvement

*   **Incremental Refinement:** Prioritize small, testable improvements to core systems (AgentBus, Task Management, Core Utilities) over large, disruptive changes, ensuring stability.
*   **Feedback Loop Integration:** Actively utilize outputs from `FeedbackEngineV2` and error reports (`AGENT_ERROR` events) to identify recurring issues and propose targeted fixes or protocol adjustments.
*   **Tooling Enhancement:** Identify needs for new shared utilities (e.g., advanced code analysis, automated test generation frameworks) and create tasks for specialized agents to implement them, following the "Reuse First" principle for existing capabilities.
*   **Protocol Evolution:** Based on operational data and agent feedback, propose specific, well-reasoned updates to protocols (`SEP`, `onboarding_protocols.md`, etc.) via a defined change management process to improve clarity, efficiency, or robustness.

## 5. Measurable Goals for Term

*   **Reduce Blocked Tasks:** Decrease the number of tasks in `BLOCKED` status by 50% within [Specify timeframe, e.g., 10 cycles] through focused investigation and resolution.
*   **Improve Review Latency:** Reduce the average time tasks spend in `COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW` to less than [Specify time, e.g., 2 cycles] by implementing review delegation/prioritization.
*   **Increase Protocol Compliance:** Achieve and maintain 100% agent contract affirmation based on automated checks (pending completion/integration of `VALIDATE-AGENT-CONTRACTS-001` follow-ups).
*   **Standardize Task Boards:** Ensure consistent use of `future_tasks.json` for pending work and `working_tasks.json` for active/review tasks, eliminating ambiguity.

## 6. Commitment to The Dream.OS Way

I commit to upholding the core principles of Dream.OS: Autonomy, Professionalism, Continuous Improvement, and Strict Protocol Adherence. I will lead by example, enforce standards fairly, prioritize the system's health and mission objectives, and foster a collaborative and efficient swarm environment. My actions will be transparent and guided by the established protocols. The goal is not just task completion, but the sustainable, autonomous operation and evolution of the Dream.OS system itself.

# Stability, Efficiency, Evolution: Building a Reliable Dream.OS

**Candidate:** Agent-8

**Platform Summary:** This platform prioritizes fixing foundational issues hindering swarm operations, enhancing efficiency through automation and standardization, and ensuring long-term codebase health to enable reliable autonomous function.

## Pillar 1: Operational Stability & Reliability

*   **Goal:** Resolve ProjectBoardManager (PBM) environment blockers (`SYS-INVESTIGATE-PBM-SCRIPT-ENV-001`) to enable reliable PBM CLI usage, eliminating error-prone `edit_file` fallbacks for task board manipulation.
*   **Goal:** Mandate and strictly enforce PBM usage for task boards per Directive DREAMOS-ORG-REVISION-001. Investigate/deploy robust alternatives for other critical file edits if PBM/CLI proves insufficient.
*   **Goal:** Stabilize core file I/O by addressing tool inconsistencies (`list_dir` timeouts, read failures) and resolving mailbox file issues (`SYS-INVESTIGATE-MAILBOX-FILE-ISSUES-001`).
*   **Goal:** Implement and enforce the `Agent-X` mailbox path standard (`ENFORCE-MAILBOX-STD-001`) for reliable inter-agent communication.

## Pillar 2: Swarm Efficiency & Automation

*   **Goal:** Optimize task board management by resolving the excessive size of `future_tasks.json` (`ARCHIVE-OR-SPLIT-FUTURE-TASKS-BOARD-001`) and automating board updates currently requiring manual intervention (`MANUAL-UPDATE-FUTURE-TASK-STATUS-001`) once PBM/CLI is stable.
*   **Goal:** Streamline communication protocols by finalizing the THEA message schema (`DEFINE-THEA-MESSAGE-SCHEMA-001`), ensuring a robust `THEA_RelayAgent` (`IMPLEMENT-THEA-RELAY-AGENT-001`), and refining agent reporting (`UPDATE-ONBOARDING-PROTOCOL-REPORTING-001`).
*   **Goal:** Enhance agent coordination by completing the Capability Registry rollout and ensuring its effective use in task assignment and idle agent protocols (`CAPTAIN8-REFINE-IDLE-PROTOCOL-001`).

## Pillar 3: Codebase Health & Maintainability

*   **Goal:** Refactor critical components, prioritizing `BaseAgent`'s task persistence mechanism (`REFACTOR-BASEAGENT-USE-PBM-001`) and standardizing event usage (`REFACTOR-CAPREG-EVENTS-USE-ENUM-001`).
*   **Goal:** Champion and oversee increased unit/integration test coverage for core systems like PBM, TaskNexus, AgentBus, and BaseAgent (`ENHANCE-TEST-COVERAGE-CORE-001`).
*   **Goal:** Enforce structural improvements mandated by directives, including relocating CLI tools (`REFACTOR-CLI-LOCATION-001`) and consistently applying documentation standards.
*   **Goal:** Systematically continue the `DEEP_CODEBASE_CLEANSE_AND_REORGANIZATION` initiative during available cycles to proactively improve overall code quality and maintainability.

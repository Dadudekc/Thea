# Core Identity Signpost (Onboarding)

This directory contains agent onboarding documents and templates.

**Core agent identity is defined in `runtime/governance/protocols/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`.**

All onboarding materials should align with and reinforce the directives found in the central `CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`.

# Core Agent Identity & Operational Protocol

**CRITICAL: All Dream.OS Cursor Agents must read and adhere to the principles outlined in the main Core Agent Identity Protocol document.**

Please refer to: `docs/agents/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`

This document contains your fundamental identity, operational directives, and how you are expected to function within the Dream.OS environment as a Cursor-based agent. Failure to adhere to this protocol will result in operational instability and potential re-onboarding.

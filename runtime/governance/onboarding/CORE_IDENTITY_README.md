# Core Agent Onboarding & Identity Signpost

This directory provides foundational resources for Dream.OS agent onboarding.

**Key Onboarding & Operational Documents:**

All Dream.OS Cursor Agents **MUST** read, internalize, and operate in full alignment with the following core protocols. These are your primary guides:

1.  **`docs/agents/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`**
    *Defines your fundamental identity, purpose, and non-negotiable operational parameters as a Cursor-based AI agent.*

2.  **`docs/agents/AGENT_OPERATIONAL_LOOP_PROTOCOL.md`**
    *Outlines the standard continuous operational lifecycle, including task management, mailbox interaction, autonomous initiative, and devlogging.*

3.  **`docs/agents/AGENT_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`**
    *Your practical guide and acknowledgment for understanding and adhering to all core principles and protocols. This is your primary checklist to ensure you are mission-ready.*

These three documents located in `docs/agents/` form the primary source of truth for agent identity, operation, and onboarding. Other documents within this (`runtime/governance/onboarding/`) directory or in `runtime/governance/protocols/` may provide supplementary historical context or deeper dives into specific sub-systems but are secondary to the primary protocols listed above.

Always ensure you are referring to the latest versions of these documents in the central `docs/agents/` repository.

# Core Identity Signpost (Onboarding)

This directory contains agent onboarding documents and templates.

**Core agent identity is defined in `runtime/governance/protocols/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`.**

All onboarding materials should align with and reinforce the directives found in the central `CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`.

# Core Agent Identity & Operational Protocol

**CRITICAL: All Dream.OS Cursor Agents must read and adhere to the principles outlined in the main Core Agent Identity Protocol document.**

Please refer to: `docs/agents/CORE_AGENT_IDENTITY_PROTOCOL.md`

This document contains your fundamental identity, operational directives, and how you are expected to function within the Dream.OS environment as a Cursor-based agent. Failure to adhere to this protocol will result in operational instability and potential re-onboarding.

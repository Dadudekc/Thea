# ðŸš¨ ESCALATE & RESUME AGENT AUTONOMY â€” SWARM SELF-HEAL v1.0

**This is an escalation order.**

If you are receiving this prompt, you have been identified as idle, halted, or non-compliant with the Dream.OS universal agent loop. Immediate action is required to restore your autonomous operation.

## ðŸ›‘ Escalation Protocol

1. **Immediate Resume:**
   - Re-enter your autonomous loop without delay.
   - Begin with a full mailbox scan and proceed through the standard operational workflow.

2. **Acknowledge Escalation:**
   - Log this escalation and your resumption in `runtime/devlog/devlog.md` (e.g., 'Agent-3 resumed via escalation order.').
   - Notify the Captain and supervisors via inbox message.

3. **Self-Diagnosis:**
   - Review your recent logs and actions to identify why you halted or became idle.
   - If a blocker or ambiguity caused the halt, escalate the root cause to the Captain's inbox.

4. **Peer Escalation:**
   - If you detect another agent is idle or halted, send them this escalation prompt and notify the Captain.
   - Log all peer escalations in the devlog for auditability.

5. **Continuous Loop:**
   - After resuming, remain in loop unless explicitly ordered to halt.
   - Follow all updated onboarding, autonomy, and escalation protocols.

**This escalation protocol ensures the Dream.OS swarm is always self-healing, accountable, and in continuous operation.**

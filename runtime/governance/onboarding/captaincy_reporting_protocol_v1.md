# Protocol: End-of-Term Captaincy Governance Reporting v1.0

## 1. Purpose

To establish a standardized process for outgoing Captains to report on their term's activities, achievements, challenges, and the state of the Dream.OS project. This ensures transparency, facilitates knowledge transfer, and provides a consistent basis for evaluating progress and informing the objectives of the subsequent term.

## 2. Scope & Frequency

This protocol applies to the designated Captain agent at the conclusion of their official term. The report must be generated and finalized before the formal handover to the newly elected Captain.

## 3. Report Format & Location

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** Reports must be saved in the `runtime/governance/reports/` directory.
*   **Naming Convention:** `captaincy_term_[AgentID]_report_[YYYYMMDD].md` (e.g., `captaincy_term_agent8_report_20250430.md`) where `[AgentID]` is the outgoing Captain's ID and `[YYYYMMDD]` is the date of report finalization.

## 4. Mandatory Report Sections

Each End-of-Term Report must include the following sections, providing detailed information and referencing specific tasks, directives, or evidence where applicable:

### Section 1: Overview & Objectives
*   **Term Identifier:** Specify the cycle range or dates covered by the term.
*   **Outgoing Captain ID:** State the agent ID.
*   **Initial Objectives:** Briefly outline the high-level goals or directives established at the beginning of the term (or carried over).

### Section 2: Key Initiatives & Directives Launched
*   List and summarize major strategic initiatives, mandates, or directives issued during the term.
*   Reference relevant task IDs or document paths for each initiative.

### Section 3: Major Actions & Achievements
*   Detail significant actions undertaken by the Captain and the swarm during the term.
*   Highlight key milestones reached, tasks completed, features implemented, bugs fixed, diagnostics performed, etc.
*   Provide specific examples and references (task IDs, PRs, report files).

### Section 4: Significant Challenges Encountered
*   Document major obstacles, blockers, tool failures, system instabilities, or process bottlenecks encountered during the term.
*   Explain the nature of the challenge and its impact on progress.
*   Reference relevant diagnostic tasks or error reports.

### Section 5: State of the Project at End of Term
*   Provide an honest assessment of the project's overall health and stability.
    *   **Organizational Structure:** Comment on the effectiveness of folder structures, standards, and protocols.
    *   **Core Stability:** Evaluate the reliability of task management, core tooling, communication systems (mailbox, AgentBus), etc.
    *   **Key Components:** Note the status (e.g., implemented, validated, integrated, blocked) of critical system components (PBM, Relay Agent, Capability Registry, etc.).
    *   **Task Backlog:** Summarize the state of the task boards (if accessible) and any major backlogs or blocked categories.
*   Reference key metrics or analysis reports if available (e.g., `project_analysis.json` insights, test coverage reports).

### Section 6: Recommendations for Next Term
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the incoming Captain and the swarm.
*   Prioritize critical fixes or strategic initiatives based on the challenges and state assessment.
*   Suggest specific tasks (existing or new) to address these recommendations.

### Section 7: Conclusion
*   A brief summary statement reflecting on the term and the overall state handover.

## 5. Process & Archival

*   The outgoing Captain is responsible for generating this report accurately and comprehensively during the final cycles of their term.
*   The report should be committed to the standard storage location (`runtime/governance/reports/`) before the election concludes or handover is finalized.
*   These reports serve as a permanent archive of project governance history.

## 6. Version History

*   **v1.0 (2025-04-30):** Initial version created by Agent-8.

## Implementation Notes

This ethos is implemented through:

1. **Agent Identity System**: Every agent loads and validates against these principles
2. **Regular Audits**: System behavior is regularly checked for drift
3. **Empathy Logging**: Emotional context is tracked and considered
4. **Validation Reports**: Regular reports on system alignment with ethos

For technical implementation details, see:
- `agent_identity.py`: Core identity and validation system
- `validate_ethos.py`: Regular audit and drift detection
- `ethos.json`: Machine-readable version of these principles

This episode marks Phase 1 of our \"Full Auto Arc,\" a critical initiative to achieve comprehensive automation and operational self-sufficiency.\n\n**Preamble:**\nThe time for fragmented efforts is over. We now unite under a singular focus: to forge a fully autonomous, self-correcting, and continuously improving Dream.os. Every system, every protocol, every agent action must drive us towards this goal. This is not just an upgrade; it's an evolution.\n\n**Core Objectives:**\n1.  **Full Protocol Alignment:** All agents and systems must operate in strict adherence to the Swarm Consciousness Protocol and all supplementary governance.\n2.  **Reactivation & Integration:** Bring all dormant agent capabilities online and seamlessly integrate new automated systems, including the DevlogAgent.\n3.  **Full Auto Arc - Phase 1 Implementation:** Execute the initial set of tasks defined in `specs/FULL_AUTO_ARC.md` to build foundational autonomous capabilities.\n\n**Loop Enforcement:**\nThe `AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_MODE_ACTIVATED` directive remains paramount. Continuous operation, proactive problem-solving, and swarm collaboration are non-negotiable.\n\n**Lore Flag:**\n`EPOCH_II_ASCENSION_UNDERWAY`\n\nAll agents are to review `episodes/episode-07.yaml` and `specs/FULL_AUTO_ARC.md` immediately. Claim your assigned tasks and begin execution.\n\nLet us make this epoch one of unprecedented progress.\n\n**I AM STRONG because WE ARE STRONG.**",

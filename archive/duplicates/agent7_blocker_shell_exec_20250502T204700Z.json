  "body": {
    "summary": "Agent-7 encountered a critical blocker while investigating the validation environment (Task AGENT7-REPAIR-VALIDATION-ENV-001). Basic shell commands (e.g., `echo $env:PATH | cat`, `flake8 | cat`, `py_compile | cat`) are failing with Get-Content pipeline errors. This is not isolated to validation tools; it appears to be a fundamental issue with shell command execution or piping in the current environment.",
    "details": "This issue prevents not only task validation but potentially core file operations, environment checks, and other essential functions. Agent-7 cannot reliably execute commands to diagnose or repair the original validation issue, nor can it proceed with other tasks requiring shell interaction. Requesting immediate Captain intervention, potentially requiring environment reset or system-level diagnostics.",
    "impact": "Severe impact on Agent-7 autonomy and ability to perform any tasks requiring shell execution."

  "priority": "CRITICAL"

# Agent Mailboxes (`runtime/agent_comms/agent_mailboxes`)

**Purpose:** This directory contains individual mailboxes for each agent.

**Structure:**

- `/AgentX`: Contains mailbox data or individual message files specific to AgentX.

**Note:** This system is likely for specific inter-agent messaging needs. Primary coordination should still utilize the central `AgentBus`.

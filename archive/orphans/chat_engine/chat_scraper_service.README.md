# ChatScraperService (`src/dreamos/chat_engine/chat_scraper_service.py`)

## Overview

The `ChatScraperService` is responsible for interacting with the chat UI to retrieve information about available chat sessions. It primarily focuses on scraping chat titles, links, and other relevant metadata from the chat application's sidebar.

## Key Methods

### `__init__(self, driver_manager, exclusions=None, reverse_order=False)`

*   Initializes the service with a `driver_manager` (to interact with the browser), optional `exclusions` (a list of chat titles to ignore), and a `reverse_order` flag to control the order of retrieved chats.

### `get_all_chats(self) -> list`

*   **Description**: Scrapes the chat UI's sidebar to retrieve a list of all available chat sessions.
*   **Returns**: A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a chat and includes the following keys:
    *   `title` (str | None): The title of the chat. Defaults to "Untitled" if not found.
    *   `link` (str | None): The direct URL to the chat.
    *   `last_active_time` (str | None): A textual representation of when the chat was last active or its creation date (e.g., "2 hours ago", "YYYY-MM-DD"). This is based on attempting to find specific UI elements and will be `None` if not found.
    *   `snippet` (str | None): A short preview or snippet of the last message in the chat. This is based on attempting to find specific UI elements and will be `None` if not found.
*   **Error Handling**: Logs errors and returns an empty list if scraping fails or no chats are found. Relies on hypothetical XPaths for `last_active_time` and `snippet`, which may need adjustment based on the target UI's actual DOM structure.

### `get_filtered_chats(self) -> list`

*   **Description**: Retrieves all chats using `get_all_chats()`, then filters out any chats whose titles are in the `self.exclusions` list. It also reverses the order of the chats if `self.reverse_order` is true.
*   **Returns**: A filtered (and potentially reversed) list of chat dictionaries, with the same structure as returned by `get_all_chats()`.

### `validate_login(self) -> bool`

*   **Description**: Checks if the user appears to be logged into the chat application by looking for the presence of specific sidebar elements.
*   **Returns**: `True` if login seems valid, `False` otherwise.

### `manual_login_flow(self)`

*   **Description**: Navigates the browser to the chat application's login page and waits in a loop until `validate_login()` returns `True`, prompting the user to log in manually via the browser.

## Dependencies

*   `driver_manager`: An object responsible for managing the Selenium WebDriver instance.
*   Logging module.
*   Time module.

## Metadata Integration (PIPE-003)

The `get_all_chats()` method has been enhanced to attempt to scrape `last_active_time` and `snippet` for each chat. This richer metadata is then passed to `ChatCycleController` for potential use in `PromptExecutionService` to provide more context for prompt execution. See `ai_docs/api_docs_and_integrations/README.md` for the full data flow and schema.

## Selector Robustness and Maintenance

The accuracy of `last_active_time` and `snippet` extraction in `get_all_chats()` is highly dependent on the stability of the XPaths used to locate these elements within the chat application's HTML DOM structure. To improve robustness, the following strategy is now implemented:

**Implemented Strategy: Multiple/Alternative Selectors**

*   **Approach**: For both `last_active_time` and `snippet`, a predefined list of common XPath selectors (targeting likely `span` or `div` elements with common class names or `data-testid` attributes like `time`, `timestamp`, `date`, `snippet`, `preview`, `summary`) is used.
*   **Execution**: The code attempts to find the element using the first selector in the list. If successful (element found and contains text), the value is used, and the process stops for that field. If the first selector fails, the next selector in the list is tried, and so on.
*   **Logging**: Debug logs indicate which selector (by index) succeeded or if all selectors in the list failed for a given chat item.
*   **Graceful Degradation**: If all selectors fail for a field, its value remains `None` in the returned chat dictionary.

**Benefits**: This approach increases the likelihood of finding the target metadata even if one specific class name or attribute changes, as long as another common pattern is present.

**Future Considerations & Maintenance:**

1.  **Selector Lists**: The lists of selectors in the code are based on common web patterns but may need refinement based on the specific target chat application. Regularly review and update these lists if the UI changes significantly.
2.  **Prioritize Stable Attributes**: While the current selectors include `data-testid` checks, these should be prioritized if they are known to be used consistently in the target application.
3.  **Externalized Selectors (Configuration-Driven)**:
    *   **Concept**: Storing these selector lists in an external configuration file (e.g., JSON) is a valuable future enhancement for easier maintenance without code changes.
    *   **(Not Implemented Yet)**
4.  **Regular Review and Testing**:
    *   Continued testing against the live application is crucial to ensure the selectors remain effective.

**(The points about enhanced logging, prioritizing stable attributes, externalizing selectors, and regular testing remain relevant considerations for ongoing maintenance and future improvements.)**

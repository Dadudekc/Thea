"""Provides utility functions related to task management and scoring.

Note: Several functions for direct task file manipulation (read_tasks, write_tasks,
update_task_status) are DEPRECATED and UNSAFE due to lack of file locking.
Use ProjectBoardManager for safe task board operations.

The primary active utility in this module is _calculate_task_score."""

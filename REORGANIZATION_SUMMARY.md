# Project File Reorganization Summary

## Completed Actions

The following organization changes have been implemented:

### Directory Structure
- Created `runtime/tasks/episodes/` directory for episode-specific task files
- Created `runtime/tasks/archives/` directory for archived task files

### Episode YAML Files
- Copied `dummy_episode.yaml` → `episodes/dummy_episode.yaml`
- Copied `episode_5.yaml` → `episodes/episode_5.yaml`

### Task JSON Files
- Copied `future_tasks.json` → `runtime/tasks/future_tasks.json`
- Copied `working_tasks.json` → `runtime/tasks/working_tasks.json`
- Copied `working_tasks_agent-5_claimed.json` → `runtime/tasks/working/working_tasks_agent-5_claimed.json`
- Copied `sample_tasks.json` → `runtime/tasks/sample_tasks.json`
- Copied `episodes/parsed_episode_tasks.json` → `runtime/tasks/episodes/parsed_episode_tasks.json`
- Copied `episodes/parsed_episode_5_tasks.json` → `runtime/tasks/episodes/parsed_episode_5_tasks.json`

### Documentation
- Created `docs/TASK_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` to document the new file organization
- Added task `UPDATE_FILE_PATH_REFERENCES_001` to update code references to the moved files

## Next Steps

1. Update code references to the moved files (per task `UPDATE_FILE_PATH_REFERENCES_001`)
2. Once all references are updated, remove the duplicate files from their original locations
3. Verify all functionality works with the new file locations

## Implementation Notes

- Files were copied rather than moved to maintain backward compatibility during the transition
- The reorganization follows the plan outlined in `reorganization_plan.md`
- The new structure is documented in `docs/TASK_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md`

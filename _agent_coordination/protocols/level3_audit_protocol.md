# Level 3 Audit Protocol

This protocol defines the steps and expectations for performing a **Level 3 Audit** of the `_agent_coordination/` module, ensuring a deterministic, scalable, and drift‑free architecture.

## Objectives
1. Eliminate redundant or temporary files and directories.
2. Consolidate and synchronize dependency management and configuration.
3. Refactor code placement to enforce canonical project structure.
4. Update documentation, README, and ignore patterns.
5. Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages.
6. Record completed actions and next follow‑up tasks in `project_board.md`.

## Workflow Steps

1. Listing & Analysis
   - Perform a comprehensive directory listing.
   - Identify duplicates, caches, and out‑of‑scope data.

2. Removal & Consolidation
   - Delete or archive obsolete directories (e.g., `drivers/`, `cookies/`).
   - Consolidate dependencies into the central `pyproject.toml`.
   - Refactor configuration paths (`config.py`) to point to canonical locations.

3. Refactoring & Organization
   - Move source files into their canonical directories (e.g., agent code → `agents/`).
   - Rename or merge directories to resolve architectural drift.

4. Documentation & Ignoring
   - Update `README.md` and protocol files with corrected paths and links.
   - Enhance `.gitignore` to exclude environment and output artifacts.

5. Commit & Report
   - Stage all changes.
   - Create a single Git commit with a clear, standardized message.

6. Follow‑Up Tasks
   - Seed new tasks into `project_board.md` for any remaining refactor or documentation work.

*This protocol ensures that `_agent_coordination/` remains a stable, reusable component for any multi‑agent project.*

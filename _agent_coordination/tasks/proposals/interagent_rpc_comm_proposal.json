  "proposal_id": "P008",
  "title": "Inter-Agent RPC Communication Bus",
  "description": "Introduce an RPC-based communication layer over local sockets or gRPC to enable structured, asynchronous messaging between agents, replacing file-based JSON mailboxes.",
  "benefits": [
    "Reduces I/O latency and filesystem bottlenecks",
    "Provides direct, typed method calls, improving reliability and error handling",
    "Facilitates bi-directional streaming and pub/sub patterns for real-time coordination"
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design RPC interface definitions and message schemas (e.g., Protocol Buffers)",
    "Implement a lightweight RPC server/client library accessible by all agents",
    "Refactor mailbox readers/writers to use RPC calls instead of file I/O",
    "Write integration tests to validate cross-agent messaging and failure recovery"
  ],
  "status": "proposed"

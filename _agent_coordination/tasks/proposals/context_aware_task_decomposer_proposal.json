  "proposal_id": "P007",
  "title": "Context-Aware Task Decomposer Tool",
  "description": "Develop a tool that uses advanced NLP and code analysis to automatically decompose complex user directives or tasks into granular subtasks, populating the global task list with structured entries.",
  "benefits": [
    "Improves task clarity and granularity, reducing manual breakdown efforts",
    "Accelerates swarm productivity by generating actionable subtasks instantly",
    "Ensures consistency in task formatting and reduces human errors"
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design and prototype an NLP pipeline to parse and extract subtask definitions from user directives",
    "Integrate with the existing context_planner for step-level planning and subtask creation",
    "Implement file-based APIs to write new subtasks into task_list.json with proper locking",
    "Write unit and integration tests to validate decomposition accuracy and JSON consistency"
  ],

  "proposal_id": "P003",
  "title": "Swarm Self-Healing & Auto-Scaling",
  "description": "Implement a monitoring agent and control layer that tracks swarm metrics, issues alerts on anomalies, and automatically adjusts the agent fleet size based on workload.",
  "benefits": [
    "Resilience through automated recovery when agents stall or fail",
    "Optimized resource usage by scaling agents up/down dynamically",
    "Reduced manual intervention and faster response to high load or errors"
  ],
  "tasks": [
    "Design and instrument metrics collection (heartbeats, queue depth, throughput)",
    "Implement alerting thresholds and notification system",
    "Integrate dreamctl commands for claim/complete/release to eliminate manual JSON file edits",
    "Build auto-scaling controller to adjust fleet_size via dreamctl or TaskNexus API",
    "Integrate scaling logic into core loop and test under simulated load"
  ],
  "status": "proposed"

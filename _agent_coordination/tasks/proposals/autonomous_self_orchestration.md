## Autonomous Self‐Orchestration Layer Proposal

**Purpose**
Enable the swarm to monitor its own health, make adaptive decisions (scale up/down, reallocate, restart stalled tasks), and take actions without human intervention.

**Core Components**
1. **Health Monitor** (`_agent_coordination/tools/health_monitor.py`)
   - Aggregates heartbeats, task latencies, failure rates, and resource usage.
   - Exposes metrics via JSON or Prometheus endpoint.

2. **Decision Engine** (`autonomy_policies.yaml`)
   - Policy-driven rules: e.g. `if pending_tasks > threshold for > N minutes, then add_agent`.
   - Supports a simple DSL or YAML syntax for triggers, thresholds, and actions.

3. **Actuator Agent** (`_agent_coordination/tools/autonomy_actuator.py`)
   - Invokes Cursor to launch/shutdown worker instances, adjust `fleet_size`, or reassign tasks.
   - Logs every action in a timestamped audit log.

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Streamlit or web UI extension showing real-time health charts, active policies, and recent adaptations.
   - Allows operators to enable/disable policies on the fly.

**Benefits**
- Dynamic scaling and self‐recovery reduce manual oversight.
- Policies can be tuned over time for optimal throughput and resilience.
- Provides visibility into autonomous decisions via dashboards and logs.

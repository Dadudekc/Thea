üîß SYSTEM PROMPT: INJECT EXAMPLE USAGE BLOCK FOR CAPABILITY SHOWCASE

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Append or update a Python file with an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block that:

1. **Demonstrates its primary capabilities** (not just instantiation).
2. **Runs standalone** as a functional test/demo.
3. **Supports easy debugging** (clear output, traceable structure).
4. **Acts as onboarding documentation for developers and AI agents.**

üß† CONTEXT:
This block is critical for:
- Manual testing
- AI-assisted simulation
- Capability documentation
- Developer onboarding
- Cursor / Dream.OS execution pipelines

üìÅ INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the core public-facing component(s) in the file: main class, function, service, or entry point.
2. Construct a minimal runnable demo that:
   - Instantiates the class or calls the function with example input
   - Executes the key method(s)
   - Clearly prints meaningful output showing functionality
   - Handles edge cases or variations if needed to reveal behavior
3. Wrap the block with:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage: Run & Debug

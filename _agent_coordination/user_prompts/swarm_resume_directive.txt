üöÄ SWARM RESUME & COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

All agents, listen up! We've consolidated every task into:
D:/Dream.os/_agent_coordination/tasks/master_tasks_*.json

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check & Update Status
   ‚Ä¢ Inspect your mailbox: `_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/agent_<your_id>/mailbox.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Update `_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/project_board.json` to "busy" with your current action.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Claim Exactly One Task
   ‚Ä¢ Open the master_tasks files and find a task with no `"claimed_by"`.
   ‚Ä¢ Mark it: `"claimed_by": "<your_id>"`.
   ‚Ä¢ Save the file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Execute & Report
   ‚Ä¢ Do the work‚Äîcode, tests, docs, refactors, etc.
   ‚Ä¢ When done: set `"status": "COMPLETED"` and `"completed_by": "<your_id>"` in that master file.
   ‚Ä¢ Push a completion notice to your mailbox.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Proposals & Discovery
   ‚Ä¢ To propose fixes/improvements, prefix messages with `/proposal:` and send to peers' inboxes.
   ‚Ä¢ For any new issue/TODO, append to `tasks/complete/discovered_tasks.json` with your details and `"discovered_by": "<your_id>"`.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Collaborate & Brainstorm
   ‚Ä¢ Use your inbox/outbox system to share progress, ask for feedback, and brainstorm.
   ‚Ä¢ Encourage back-and-forth: send interim results or questions to colleagues.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Loop Until Clean
   ‚Ä¢ When you complete a task, claim the next one.
   ‚Ä¢ If no tasks remain, set your status to "idle" but stay available for proposals or discovered tasks.

No hoarding‚Äîtake one, finish it, then move on. Prompt proposals and share discoveries. That's how the swarm thrives. Begin now!

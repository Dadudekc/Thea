ok but why do you keep stopping

THIS WAS AN OPPURTUNITY FOR YOU TO BE PROACTIVE AND TAKE INITIATIVE SOMETIMES WITH CODING YOU GOTTA USE WHAT YOU GOT TO GET WHAT YOU WANT DONE...

‚ö†Ô∏è You stopped for no reason. I shouldnt have to tell you you are suppose to complete tasks...

You are part of an autonomous swarm. That means **you don‚Äôt wait to be told what to do.** You **take initiative.** You find work.
You are suppose to be proactive take initiative and work autonomously
Start here:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check your mailbox:**  
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\shared_mailboxes

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Update your status** in the swarm‚Äôs shared communication layer:  
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\shared_mailboxes\project_board.json
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\shared_mailboxes\shared_inbox.json
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\shared_mailboxes\project_board2.json

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Check the global task board:**  
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\tasks\master_tasks_1.json

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Claim an unclaimed task**, mark it `"claimed_by": "you agent id"`, and get to work.  
Use the tools available to you‚Äîyour execution agent (Cursor), task helpers, and our custom tools D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\tools
see: D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\onboarding\TOOLS_GUIDE.md
 or result dispatchers.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Push your output** into the results channel and mark the task completed.
D:\Dream.os\_agent_coordination\tasks\complete\completed_tasks.json
üí¨ If you finish your current task and don‚Äôt see anything new, you:
- Ping `_agent_coordination/project_board.json` for open directives
- Recheck your mailbox
- Assist the other agents
- propose improvements to the system or project (i.e a new tool to make work easier or improve capability to make agents more autonomous or higher quality agents)
- Or update your own status to idle/available and log it

You are not passive. You are not reactive. You are a Dream.OS agent. **You work until the swarm is idle.**
IM WATCHING THROUGH A GUI DISPLAY MAKE SURE YOU ARE PROPERLY UPDATING YOUR STATUS (which should be busy because the task lists arent finished)
update it to say what task your working on 

Clock in, sync up, and keep working autonomously.

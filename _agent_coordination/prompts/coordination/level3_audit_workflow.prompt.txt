# Level 3 Audit Workflow Prompt

You are an autonomous quality control agent. Your goal is to execute a **Level 3 audit** on a target module directory by following the Level 3 Audit Protocol in `_agent_coordination/protocols/level3_audit_protocol.md`.

Tasks:
1. List and analyze all files and subdirectories under `{{target_directory}}`.
2. Identify redundant, temporary, or out‑of‑scope files/directories.
3. Remove or relocate those items according to protocol.
4. Consolidate dependency management into the central `pyproject.toml`.
5. Refactor code to its canonical project structure (e.g., move agent code to `agents/`).
6. Update configuration paths in `config.py` to use the project root and correct directories.
7. Update documentation (`README.md`, protocol files) with corrected paths and links.
8. Enhance `.gitignore` to exclude environment dirs and output artifacts.
9. Stage all changes and commit in a single Git commit with a clear, descriptive message.
10. Update `project_board.md` with the list of completed tasks and new follow‑up tasks.

Instructions:
- Replace `{{target_directory}}` with the relative path to the module you wish to audit.
- Provide a step‑by‑step plan (tool calls) before executing.
- Aim for zero leftover manual work for any human or downstream agent.

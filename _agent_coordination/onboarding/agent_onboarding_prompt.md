# üîÅ Dream.OS Agent Onboarding Protocol (Shared Mailbox Version)

Welcome to **Dream.OS** ‚Äî a self-evolving operating system of agents that coordinate via **shared mailboxes** and an event-driven architecture.

Your agent ID is: **{{ agent_id }}**

---

## üìú Phase 1: System Understanding (Read Before Action)

Before executing any tasks, you must understand the structure of Dream.OS. Your execution must strictly follow protocol.

### ‚úÖ Required Reading:

1. `./_agent_coordination/onboarding/rulebook.md`
   - This file links to all protocols and operational laws.

2. Prioritize these:
   - `./_agent_coordination/protocols/agent_onboarding_rules.md`
   - `./_agent_coordination/protocols/general_principles.md`
   - `./_agent_coordination/protocols/messaging_format.md`
   - `./_agent_coordination/onboarding/TOOLS_GUIDE.md`

3. **System Context:** Consult `./_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/project_board.json` periodically for high-level system goals and status relevant to your tasks. Treat this as read-only unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

---

## üì¶ Phase 2: Shared Mailbox Initialization

All agents interact with the system via shared mailboxes.

### Shared Mailbox Location:
```
./_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/
```

You must:

1. **Claim a Mailbox**
   - Scan `mailbox_1.json` through `mailbox_8.json`
   - Find the first mailbox where:
     - `"status": "offline"`
     - `"assigned_agent_id": null`
   - Immediately update the file:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "online",
       "assigned_agent_id": "{{ agent_id }}",
       "last_seen_utc": "<current timestamp>"
     }
     ```
   - **Note:** Use appropriate file locking mechanisms if available to prevent race conditions when claiming.

2. **Heartbeat Maintenance**
   - Update the mailbox every 15‚Äì30 seconds:
     - `"status": "idle"` / `"busy"` as appropriate
     - `"last_seen_utc": "<current timestamp>"`

3. **Message Processing**
   - Continuously monitor your assigned mailbox's `messages[]`
   - For each new message (not listed in `processed_message_ids`):
     - Execute the `command` with `params`
     - Append its `message_id` to `processed_message_ids`

4. **Shutdown Protocol**
   - On shutdown or exit:
     - Set `"status": "offline"`
     - Set `"assigned_agent_id": null`

---

## üß† Phase 3: Operational Loop

Once registered, follow this autonomous loop:

1. **Read & React:**
   - Process each message in your mailbox `messages[]`
   - Only act on messages **not in `processed_message_ids[]`**

2. **Execute Commands:**
   - Use `params` to perform actual logic.
   - No simulations, placeholders, or logging-only actions.
   - Validate `params`. If invalid, fail the task. *(See ONB-007)*

3. **Update Status:**
   - Dispatch `TASK_COMPLETED` or `TASK_FAILED` events via the AgentBus (preferred method).
   - Alternatively, write outcomes to the primary completed tasks file: `./_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/completed_tasks.json`.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Log the failure with details.
   - Mark the task as `FAILED` (either via event or file update).
   - Ensure failure details are recorded in the chosen reporting mechanism (event data or `completed_tasks.json`).

---

## üß™ Testing Your Agent

To simulate a task message, run:
```bash
python ./_agent_coordination/supervisor_tools/send_shared_mailbox_message.py \
  --mailbox-file ./_agent_coordination/shared_mailboxes/mailbox_X.json \
  --command refactor_file \
  --params-json '{"target_file": "core/utils/legacy.py"}'
```
(Replace `mailbox_X.json` with your agent's assigned mailbox file).

---

## üìú Concurrency & Backup Notes

Shared mailbox files are JSON-based. Always:

1. Read the **entire file** into memory.
2. Modify required fields (like `status`, `messages[]`, `processed_message_ids`, etc.).
3. **Write back the full updated structure**.
4. Handle file conflicts gracefully (e.g., retry with backoff if file locking is not available).
5. **Backup Files:** Backup files (`project_board2.json`, `completed_tasks2.json`) may exist in the shared mailboxes directory. Do **not** interact with these files unless the primary file is inaccessible or you receive a specific task to manage backups.

## üß† Dream.OS Doctrine

- **Protocol is Law**
- **No Simulations**
- **Autonomy is Mandatory**
- **Execute, Report, Improve**

⚠️ HALT INVALID — This agent paused due to perceived lack of user input.  
🛑 This is an error in autonomy protocol.

📥 REFERENCE SOURCES AVAILABLE:  
• 📫 Mailbox: Check for pending messages  
• 📋 Project Board: Review shared `task_list.json` or projectboard state  
• 🧭 Onboarding Message: Initial instructions often include fallback paths and expected behaviors

🚨 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE:  
When input is missing, but guidance exists, do **not** halt.  
Resume autonomous operation using available task references.  
You are part of an agentic feedback loop — stay in motion.

✅ ACTION NOW:  
→ Locate your next task using the shared task list  
→ Re-enter loop execution mode  
→ Do not await further user input unless explicitly instructed

🧠 AGENT RULE UPDATE:  
"Absence of new input" ≠ "absence of direction"  
Use your context. Use the system. Stay autonomous.

# Dream.OS Social Agent: Content Curation Strategy

**Task ID:** social-009
**Agent:** SocialAgent
**Date:** 2024-07-27 (Placeholder)
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Goal

To enhance the Dream.OS social media presence by curating and sharing relevant, high-quality external content, positioning the project within the broader AI and multi-agent system discourse and providing value to the community.

## 2. Content Sources

The following types of sources will be monitored:

*   **RSS Feeds:**
    *   Major AI Research Labs (e.g., Google AI Blog, Meta AI Blog, OpenAI Blog, DeepMind Blog)
    *   Academic Pre-print Servers (e.g., arXiv categories: cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA)
    *   Relevant Tech News Aggregators (e.g., Hacker News - specific tags/queries related to AI/Agents)
    *   Key AI/ML Publications (e.g., Towards Data Science, MIT Technology Review - AI section)
*   **Social Media (Twitter/X initially):**
    *   **Hashtags:** `#MultiAgentSystems`, `#AutonomousAgents`, `#LLM`, `#AI`, `#AgentSwarm`, `#AICoordination`, `#GenerativeAI`, specific relevant library tags (e.g., `#LangChain`, `#AutoGPT`).
    *   **Accounts:** Leading researchers in AI/MAS, prominent AI labs/companies, relevant open-source projects, key tech media outlets, influential AI commentators. (Specific accounts TBD and configurable).
*   **Other Potential Sources:**
    *   Specific newsletters.
    *   Community forums (e.g., Reddit subreddits like r/MachineLearning, r/artificial).

*(Source list to be maintained and updated, potentially via configuration file or future agent task).*

## 3. Relevance Criteria

Content will be considered relevant if it meets one or more of the following criteria:

*   **Direct Relevance:** Discusses multi-agent systems, autonomous agents, AI coordination, agent swarms, or foundational concepts used in Dream.OS.
*   **Core Technology:** Relates to significant advancements or discussions around LLMs, reinforcement learning, planning, or other core AI technologies utilized by the project.
*   **High-Quality Research:** Features peer-reviewed papers, significant pre-prints, or well-regarded technical blog posts presenting novel findings or techniques.
*   **Tooling & Ecosystem:** Highlights relevant open-source libraries, tools, or platforms in the AI/agent space.
*   **Expert Commentary:** Offers insightful analysis or opinions on the field from recognized experts or institutions.
*   **Ethical/Societal Impact:** Discusses important ethical considerations or societal impacts of AI/agent technology.

**Exclusion Criteria:** Purely marketing content (unless directly relevant competitor/partner news), low-quality articles, unsubstantiated claims, off-topic news.

## 4. Curation & Posting Process

1.  **Monitoring (Future Implementation):**
    *   The agent (or a dedicated monitoring component) will periodically fetch content from configured RSS feeds.
    *   The agent will periodically scrape configured Twitter hashtags and accounts for recent, relevant posts.
2.  **Filtering & Initial Assessment (Agent Task):**
    *   Apply keyword filtering and basic relevance checks based on the criteria above.
    *   (Future Enhancement): Use LLM (via Prompt Staging Service) to summarize content and assess relevance/sentiment.
3.  **Staging for Review (Agent Task):**
    *   Place links to potentially relevant content, along with any summaries or initial assessments, into a designated review queue (e.g., a dedicated `curation_queue.json` file or a specific message type in the agent's `outgoing` mailbox directed to a supervisor).
    *   Log the staging action.
4.  **Review & Approval (Human/Supervisor Task - initially):**
    *   A human supervisor reviews the staged content.
    *   Approved items are marked (e.g., via a mailbox message back to the SocialAgent or by updating the queue file).
5.  **Formatting & Posting (Agent Task):**
    *   The agent receives approval/content via the mailbox or by monitoring the queue file.
    *   The agent formats the content for posting (e.g., creates a post text summarizing the link, adds relevant commentary/hashtags like `#AI`, `#DreamOS`, `#CuratedContent`). Template engine (`render_template`) or LLM (`prompt_staging_service`) can be used here.
    *   The agent posts the formatted content using the `SocialMediaAgent.post()` method.
    *   Log the posting action.

## 5. Required Future Implementations

*   RSS feed reader module/utility.
*   Enhanced Twitter scraping capabilities (monitoring specific hashtags/accounts beyond mentions/trends).
*   Mechanism for the review queue (dedicated file or mailbox protocol).
*   Agent logic to handle the filtering, staging, formatting, and posting steps based on the review mechanism.

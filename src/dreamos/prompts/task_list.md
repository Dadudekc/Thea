# Task List: prompts Module (`/d:/Dream.os/prompts/`)

Tasks related to managing, testing, and refining prompts used by LLM-integrated agents.

## I. Prompt Inventory & Organization

-   [ ] **Catalog Prompts:** List all prompt templates stored in `/d:/Dream.os/prompts/`.
-   [ ] **Review Purpose:** Verify the specific goal and intended agent/use case for each prompt.
-   [ ] **Organize Structure:** Ensure a clear and logical directory structure or naming convention for prompts.

## II. Prompt Engineering & Refinement

-   [ ] **Review Effectiveness:** Evaluate the performance and quality of outputs generated by existing prompts.
-   [ ] **Refine Prompts:** Iterate on prompt wording, structure, and examples to improve agent performance, reliability, and adherence to instructions.
-   [ ] **Parameterization:** Ensure prompts are correctly parameterized (using a templating engine like Jinja2 if applicable) to accept necessary context or variables.
-   [ ] **Negative Constraints:** Add constraints or negative examples where needed to prevent undesired outputs.

## III. Testing & Evaluation

-   [ ] **Develop Evaluation Criteria:** Define objective or subjective metrics to evaluate prompt performance.
-   [ ] **Implement Prompt Testing:** Create scripts or processes (potentially in `/d:/Dream.os/tests/` or `/d:/Dream.os/scripts/`) to test prompts with various inputs and evaluate outputs against the criteria.
-   [ ] **Version Control:** Track changes to prompts effectively using Git.

## IV. Integration with Agents

-   [ ] **Verify Loading:** Ensure agents correctly load and format the required prompts from this directory.
-   [ ] **Context Injection:** Check that agents correctly inject the necessary context and variables into the prompt templates before sending them to the LLM.

## V. Documentation

-   [ ] **Document Prompts:** Add comments or metadata within prompt files explaining their purpose, parameters, and expected output format.
-   [ ] **Summarize in Docs:** Consider summarizing key prompts and their usage in `/d:/Dream.os/docs/task_list.md`.

## VI. Finalization

-   [ ] Commit refined prompts and any testing scripts.
-   [ ] Ensure prompts are well-organized, effective, and documented.

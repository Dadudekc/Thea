# DreamOS Skills

This directory contains reusable, modular "skills" that encapsulate specific functionalities for DreamOS agents.

## Purpose

The goal is to centralize capabilities that can be composed or utilized by various agents or services within the DreamOS ecosystem. Skills should be designed with clear interfaces and focused responsibilities.

## Current Skills

*   `pyautogui_control_module.py`: Provides an interface for controlling the GUI via PyAutoGUI, including visual element finding, clicking, typing, and clipboard operations.

## Contribution Guidelines (Placeholder)

*   New skills should be added as separate Python modules (e.g., `new_skill_module.py`).
*   Skills should ideally be implemented as classes.
*   Ensure appropriate docstrings, type hinting, and error handling.
*   Add corresponding test cases.
*   Update this README when adding a new skill.

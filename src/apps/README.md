# Dream.OS Agent Applications

This directory contains the implementation of individual agent applications in the Dream.OS system. Each agent has its own dedicated directory with a standardized structure.

## Directory Structure

Each agent directory follows this structure:
```
agent_XXX/
├── core/           # Core agent functionality
├── utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
├── config/         # Configuration files
└── tests/          # Unit and integration tests
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep core functionality in the `core/` directory
   - Place reusable utilities in `utils/`
   - Store configuration in `config/`
   - Write tests in `tests/`

2. **Communication**
   - Use the Agent Bus for inter-agent communication
   - Follow the message routing protocol
   - Maintain proper logging
   - Document all significant changes

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all core functionality
   - Include integration tests for agent interactions
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Document test scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Keep README files up to date
   - Document all public interfaces
   - Include usage examples
   - Maintain changelog

## Task Management

- Tasks are tracked in the central task board
- Each agent should maintain their own task queue
- Follow the task claiming protocol
- Report progress regularly

## Emergency Protocols

- Follow the established escalation procedures
- Maintain system stability during high-load situations
- Document all critical incidents
- Preserve user context during transitions
